This is really important as he is now the most well know First Nations Australian.  First Nations Australians make up less than 3% of the Australian population. Many are fair skinned like Charlton. First Nations men are more likely to go to prison than to University. So Charlton’s success sets that tone that anything is possible to Young First Nations people."
