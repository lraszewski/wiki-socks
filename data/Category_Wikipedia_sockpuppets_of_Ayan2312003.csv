I edited this things for the readers convenience please accept the edit."
2020-04-07T22:56:56+00:00,949686907,949686111,1,Ayan2312003,Arjuna,The information in this article was very limited and it stated that Arjuna killed Karna fairly which is not correct in fact in the original epic it is clearly mentioned that the death of karna was unfair and I pointed out just that along with some references from Karna Parva.
2020-04-07T22:50:01+00:00,949686111,949684618,1,Ayan2312003,Arjuna,"According to original mahabharata Arjuna was not an Atimaharathi, he was a maharathi who is equal to 3 maharathis as stated in original mahabharata text."

2020-04-07T22:27:47+00:00,949683653,949682345,1,Aman742000,Hindu mythological wars,"Two weapons bramhariksja and Bramhadand astra were only acquired by one warrior in Mahabharata and his name was Karna but the article didn't mentioned his name in any of those descriptions of astras, may  be it was a mistake or hatred towards that character, I don't know,but this information is very necessary and I thought to contribute it by mentioning the facts."
2020-04-07T22:17:16+00:00,949682345,949681838,1,Aman742000,Hindu mythological wars,"Here in this article again Arjuna is put in the Atimaharthi class and going by the original edition written by Ved Vyasa there is no mention of any warrior in Atimaharthi class during Mahabharata, I edited and Put Arjuna and Karna in the Maharathi class where they originally belonged in the official edition of the epic."

2020-04-07T22:11:05+00:00,949681710,949585510,1,Aman742000,Hindu mythological wars,"In this article a lot of false and misleading figures are given, in the original Mahabharata no warrior was considered as an Atimaharthi except Lord Krishna but he didn't fought. Arjuna is showed to be invincible in this article but.in the original version he is considered as an inferior warrior against Karna. It is mentioned that Abhimanyu and Arjuna are equal to 12 and 4 maharathis respectively but in this is a complete hoax as in the original Abhimanyu is equal to 1 and Arjuan is equal to 3."

Please publish my edit."

2020-04-08T13:39:36+00:00,949777551,949762644,1,Sangita_237920,Arjuna,This article has many flawed points regarding Draupadi's Swayamvara which is an event in Indian epic in Mahabharata after reading the original text I edited the part where Arjuna was confronted with Karna and the conclusion of the Swayamvara. In the Wikipedia version that part was completely false so I hope the admins would look into the matter.
