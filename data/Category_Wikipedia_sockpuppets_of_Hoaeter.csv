There is a huge difference - its like conflating the policies of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany just because they are one country. The 1991-March 2018 section, especially the text related to 2009 deals with the TPLF regimes criticism, while the April 2018-present section is for the current elected govt. They're on opposite sides of the conflict."
