You have edited the leads of several other university pages (specifically as it pertains to your misconception of boosterism) and have been consistently met with immense backlash from other editors. It thus does not make sense for your edit to prevail while we talk."

You are obviously the one who misunderstands and misrepresents Wikipedia guidelines.

On every occasion, several other editors greatly disagreed with you and reverted your edits, just as I am doing here. Your toxicity is childish and unwarranted. It is completely without merit."

You are evidently the one who deliberately fails to understand boosterism. In this case, it is completely neutral to leave the lead the way it is."

It is actually the Rankings section that needs to be updated; the original lead is objectively verifiable through various sources, making the wording accurate. The Rankings section cites an old source that suggests it's in the top 15. However, quick research reveals that UChicago is consistently ranked in the top 10 - so I remain firm."

WP:Boost warns against failing to  “describe [an academic institution] in a neutral language and verifiable facts”. It is a fact that UChicago ranks among the world’s top ten universities. Contrast this to Harvard’s profile; go take a look at their lead and see what it says: “one of the most prestigious universities in the world”."
