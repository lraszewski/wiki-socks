The mentions in it reflect opinions of few individual person and not that of a group or an organization or another religion. We are talking about the main part of Islam. and criticism should not be taken  from individual opinions. Wikipedia is not a  website that reflects opinions of individuals .

Even tough its criticism by individual the statement that Quranic language is not clear is false. The arabic is very clear and clearly understood by arabic speaker. The problem with it may arise while translating to other languages but that may be the problem with Arabic language's translation and not necessarily that of Quran.
