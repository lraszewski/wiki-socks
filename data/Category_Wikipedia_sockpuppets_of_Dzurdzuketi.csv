Why is it insulting, when many villages in the Chechen lowland have Turkic names? (Mychikich, Germenchuk, Avturi, Atagi, Mair-Tup, Ichkeria, etc) The oldest form of the word is 'Chachan', and the sources I provided prove it. See also all the 18th century maps.

There is nothing wrong with it not being 'not being of Nakh origin'. But your theory about inside theory is not objective. FYI you also edit Ingush pages, I don't see the problem. Honesty is key."

Why do you want to change the name from Gelia to Vainakh? It's confusing and you are spreading fake information unfortunately. The sources provided for the ethnonym nakhchoy don't make a direct link between Ingush and nakchoy, therefore all the provided sources don't back up the statement you are trying to make."

Reinier continuously tries to change this into Vainakh for unknown reasons? If Klaproth's work would be superseded (On what basis?), why do other sources claim the same information about the Ingush, namely that it is the head tribe of the Kists, of which multiple tribes are part of such as the Chechens, Karabulaks and Tusch? None of the sources claim nakchoy as an etnonym, which you so eagerly want."

Secondly, none of the other older sources that I provided (German, French, English) back up the fact that the etnonym Nakhchoy was used for Ingush people. See sources provided. Second of all, when taking a closer look at the source provided by Reinier, it does not mention Ingush people in any way relating it to Nakchoy or something similar, therefore I portray this as a false claim."
