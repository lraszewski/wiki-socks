How can one  EVEN know for a fact that herb ginseng or Tai Chi is harmful or yields no benefits? There's no real studies to yet claim that as a solid fact . Just lack of studies to support the benefits but lack of evidence does not really equate to everything about the Field being fraught with useless ideas. Ironically the few studies tend to show benefits of some therapies like Tai Chi, ginger, etc as they are natural and so, can't stereotype"

2021-04-16T06:06:32+00:00,1018086806,1012700347,1,Casualfoodie,History of opium in China,Arguably the most important info was omitted in the intro. The recreational use of opium was on 17th century outlawed in China and wasn't widespread. It was only when the British began flooding the Market with cheap opium in vast amounts and smuggled it in illegally. That opium trade skyrocketed yet the intro makes it appear like the British had nothing to do with the increased trade. It was illegal in Britian but they broke Chinese laws to flood the market. Added source and omitted intro info..

Unequal treaties, gunboat diplomacy, etc were realities back then and consequently Korea wanted to distance from  trading relations or diplomacy with the west. Which led to the General Sherman incident."

2021-04-15T06:58:04+00:00,1017902316,1017799634,1,Casualfoodie,United States expedition to Korea,It's not a failed verification. National interest is a reputable foreign affairs source and they wouldn't write that if they didn't do their research. Also the same source states that America disrespected Korean sovereignty by sending armed warships to travel in their waters. That's not even deniable by anyone that US wanted to force Korea to open trade. When Korea refused and made it clear they wouldn't. The punitive campaign was clearly gunboat diplomacy to make them think twice.

They were clearly wary of westereners after seeing what happened next door in China who had been defeated in opium wars and suffered gunboat policies and forced free trade where the British wanted to still continue to sell opium and the Americans themselves intervened repeatedly on behalf of the British so Korea's government was wary of their presence. Western powers were not shy to use violence or gun boat
