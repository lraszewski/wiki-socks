Sentence removed. Plato was a realist, not an idealist. the confusion stems from calling his Theory of Forms wrongly as Theory of Ideas. Plato considered the Forms to be 'universals' existing in a transcendent supernatural world as well as outside the human mind and the perceived world as their imperfect image, whereas a key note of objective  idealism is that  material objects exist in reality."
