For [[WP:BLP]]'s, contentious content should have multiple reliable sources. The allegation wasn't made by The Independent. It was an anonymous allegation from an unnamed ""former friend"" published in the Independent. Unsubstantiated allegations about him being a fascist in his younger years are already dealt with in the ""Early Years"" section, when Farage stated ""Any accusation I was ever involved in far right politics is utterly untrue."""
