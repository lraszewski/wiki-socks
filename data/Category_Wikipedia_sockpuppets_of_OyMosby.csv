Hence removing long-standing information should require talking it out on the talk page. It seems recently removed rather than added.

2024-05-21T04:28:10+00:00,1224899305,1223785732,1,OyMosby,"Split, Croatia",This was added with an edit summary “fix”. Spalato became the official name in the 18th century so it seems undue and misleading to imply it was the definitive historical name. There were multiple forms. Hence the original “others names” section redirect makes more sense. Unless there was mass consensus on this which I didn’t see?
2024-05-21T04:15:30+00:00,1224898445,1220900265,1,OyMosby,Zadar,Was there consensus for this addition? Seems numerous edit wars had followed. There wasn’t only one historical name so this is undue and pov. Mentions of Zadar in the 12th century had predated Zara of the 15th century per Etymology section. And there were other names before. Why would Zara be defacto the historical term? This implies some nation’s having more important than others. The original direction to the naming section is neutral. Has been for many years. Unless I am missing something?

Croats and Serbs existed in the Balkans in the 7th and possibly 6th century but only after the Sclaveni already arrived who were a separate non-Serbo-Croatian group upon first arrival if I am correct here. Didn’t mean to imply otherwise. I should have read more carefully. Apologies for the accusation of removing sourced material.
