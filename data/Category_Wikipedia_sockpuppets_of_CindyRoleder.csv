2017-04-13T17:08:43+00:00,775247961,775247795,1,CindyRoleder,Irreligion,Non-theism should be written with a hyphen and the second Gallup Poll was held in 2014 not in 2015
2017-04-13T17:07:25+00:00,775247795,775245276,1,CindyRoleder,Irreligion,I am not inflating the number of irreligious people but I am just saying the true reality because the provided reference clearly states that non-religious people in Germany make up at least 55% so therefore my version is fully correct.

2017-04-13T13:01:12+00:00,775216558,775161615,1,CindyRoleder,Irreligion,I have put Germany at 55% non-religious and provided a clear reference that fully confirms it because 34% is based on official membership not on true adherence so therefore in reality Germany should be 55% non-religious not 34%.
2017-04-12T10:10:41+00:00,775050639,775027841,1,CindyRoleder,List of Maltese records in athletics,I have corrected the Indoor 200 metres record because in reality there is only one official record that counts not two including one with the hand timing.
