A common misconception of the term ""assault rifle"" is not properly used. The civilian version of the M16 is known as the AR-15. AR stands for ""ArmaLite Rifle,"" not ""Assault Rifle."" This is why the term assault rifle is used incorrectly when describing rifles with large-capacity magazines. The AK-47 or ""Kalashinkov"" became the most widely developed rifle for countries on a global scale."
