He believes that his strong roots in the area, from his time serving as an MP and a medical doctor, will help PSP gain an advantage in the contest.

He has known Dr Tan since 2003, when the latter was still Member of Parliament for Ayer Rajah SMC. He was also one of Dr Tan’s assentors when the latter ran in the 2011 Presidential Election. He wants to promote equal chances for all and push for Singaporeans to be given first priority in job opportunities, he said."
