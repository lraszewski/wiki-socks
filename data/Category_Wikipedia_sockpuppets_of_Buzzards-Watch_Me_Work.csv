For the images first one can see more buildings and sailboat one is much better. that is why I originally edit because in the old sailboat one turns up on iOS as extremely pixalated. I replaced it with another sailboat :) . Also I list place names because I am trying to make it relate the reader (where it is) and why it is an important city today. thanks.
