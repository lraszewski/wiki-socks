2022-05-09T20:37:59+00:00,1087019639,1087006853,1,June_Parker,Kenosha unrest shooting,"The primary talking point of Rittenhouse's opponents, and the pretext of his criminal charges, were that he traveled there with the intention of harming BLM protesters. Supporters also claim the men he shot were racist and used slurs while attacking him. Meaning either of them could be seen as being attacked as a result of an African-American related opinion. I understand if you want to revert again though but I felt like getting my opinion out here would be alot faster."

The prejudice subtext is supported by the sources that have existed in this article for a long time already. To boot, the first sentence (Define false accusation of rape is marely claiming you were while not naming a perpatrator) is not accurate to the other sources as they define a false accusation as naming a perp for a rape that never occured. I have explained this to you in the talk page, I will gladly talk to you more if need be. But this information is cited."
