Indian constitution does not state that and parliament can legislate on anything as long as it does not violate freedom of religion (like banning triple talaq). Furthermore, the [[Hindu code bills]] have nothing 'religious' about them and are part of common law. They are secularized to the point of complete similarities of texts between them and the special marriage act. The only religious law is the Muslim Personal Law."
