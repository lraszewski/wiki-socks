I don't have a source but you can see that the tawalkna ala allah operations were decisive and the final stage of the war. I said political gains for both sides as Iraq had made Khomeni recall his declaration to overthrow Saddam, and iraq turned out in a better position on the world stage."
2023-09-30T08:49:09+00:00,1177894872,1177887518,1,CorrectingWarPage,Iran–Iraq War,I'm a new editor who made my account simply to correct the myth that it was a stalemate. Instead of reverting my edits why don't you explain why I'm wrong because at the end of the war the final operations Tawakalna ala allah (God is on our side) the Iranian Army was annihilated and there was a renewed offensive which forced khomeni to begrudgingly accept peace. I am not good at sources but you can search and see the Iranian were not happy about it and khomeni said it was like drinking a poison.
