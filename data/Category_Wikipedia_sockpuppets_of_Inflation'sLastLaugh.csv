2022-07-06T00:47:06+00:00,1096680861,1096440563,1,Inflation'sLastLaugh,Fractional-reserve banking,I'm new to WP and have been told to edit modestly at first.  This is my first attempt and I'm a little nervous and timid so I hope this small edit is OK to the God-like admins of WP.  Please Gods of WP keep some of this on the page.  You're much cleverer than me so I leave it with you to edit further.

They are indeed in good faith.  The bad faith comes from the whole financial system, but these edits are ""good faith"" edits.  As God himself would acknowledge."

This new wording gives the impression that ""banks don't have enough money"" or something -- a bad misimpression for our readers. It should be easy to adjust this language. Also, be aware that the lead must reflect sourced content in the article text. New ideas or explanations cannot first be introduced into the lead."
