2019-10-03T19:36:10+00:00,919444168,919034136,1,MIna1230,Persecution of Copts,People must understand that the Egyptian Government has always been run by foreign people with origins in West Asia. Things have improved compared to previous leaders but one must understand that there are many NGO's and media outlets who make up false stories for there own benefit and to emphasis a false images. Approximately 70% of Copts live in Upper Egypt where they have doubled in past century due to Copts higher fertility rates there but for political reasons and animosity they won't say.
2019-11-16T23:09:09+00:00,926517421,926492946,1,Adelattia01,Religion in Egypt,Rosguill you have to stop with twisting and deleting reference and information- no the pew research is an NGO with just political and false propaganda motivations in 2011 after the Arab spring.  Now Sisi government and constitutional amendments in 2013 and government run media Al Ahram with reference 3 states that approximately 10-15% are Christian don't delete reference unjumble facts and put biased info.. Clearly it is illegal according Egyptian law for NGO's to research religion.
2019-11-16T08:49:24+00:00,926426125,926358414,1,Adelattia01,Religion in Egypt,"Be cautious of NGO's like Pew Research politically motivated false propaganda and secretly corrupt. New regime with constitutional amendments since 2013 even mentioned this, clearly Egyptian state news Al Ahram mention in 2017 Christians account 10-15% of 104 million therefore 15 to 20 million are Christian and could be as high as 25 plus million with around 70% living in Upper Egypt where they have nearly doubled in the past 100 years. Check reference 4."

Why? they are disloyal liars about there identity they hate everyone and make up false rumours about others while they use my religion Islam for terrorism purposes when they are not devout and like to use Christian shelters or organisations for food and shelter
2019-10-06T20:54:54+00:00,919950917,919945719,1,Amgaw,Religion in Egypt,Wrong information the reference does not state that. As PHD graduate one has to look carefully into the founders and staff of wikipedia and Google. That explains why
2019-10-06T20:09:27+00:00,919944352,919915764,1,Amgaw,Religion in Egypt,Im sorry but you twisting facts according to the graph it is not mentioned with the reference you supplied. Now with new leader since 2013 and constitutional amendments Christians are at least over 10 million with sources such as Egyptians media even acknowledging that.
2019-11-16T09:55:20+00:00,926431780,926426125,1,Athiest3,Religion in Egypt,"In the year 1800 the population of Egypt was only 2.2 million and 200,000 Christian out of the 2.2 million 88% were native Coptic regardless of there faith. The faith conversion process was at most starting from 16th century onwards. Based on my experience there is no attitude or character difference regardless of either faith, 1 can say surrendering is not a sign of courage. Forget all these previous historians false myths."

2019-10-07T05:16:16+00:00,920010763,919950917,1,Qlpoekdei,Religion in Egypt,"Added reference from a highly educated knowledgeable individual Raymond Ibrahim based on solid evidence, there are around 15 million Christians in Upper Egypt 30-40% up from 20% last century and 6 to 9 million in Lower Egypt, which would equate to twenty something million. Previous leaders from Nasser to Morsi have always been trying to cause manipulation and deception to try to undermine Christians population in Egypt. 5% of the Arab world or Middle East is Christian and 4 out 5 are from Egypt"
2019-10-10T22:10:09+00:00,920620176,920604751,1,SamirP01,Religion in Egypt,Incorrect graph the reference you included doesn't support this information. Wikipedia is a mess with false propaganda and it should be banned due to misinformation. I remember when I first started college the teacher said wikipedia is a mess and if you do use wikipedia as a source of information you will fail.
