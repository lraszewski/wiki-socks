Although sacred text directs to religious text (and the link to Religious texts is preserved), the terms are not necessarily interchangeable, as Religious texts page notes. The regard the Latter Day Saint movement overwhelmingly proffers the Book of Mormon makes sacred text more descriptive. This is also how non-Mormon scholars describe the book's status among adherents, e.g. Gutjahr's The Book of Mormon: A Biography refers to it as ""sacred text"" of the movement."
