No matter what i am correct in changing the service slightly to what it is in real life and do you even know if your reading stuff correctly? What i said before is accurate on every site you have asked me to checked. Just leave it like this fgs.

At least half of them call at these 3 stations and ive even been on one of them stopper ones myself.

No matter what you still get a train to the stop that is put on. It doesnt run for every single service BUT IT STILL COUNTS AS IVE EVEN BEEN TO NEWCASTLE STATION 500+ times and seen services with the stations served. Even check the tpe website. They will say that Lea green, Dewsbury and northallerton are served by some of the newcastle - liverpool lime street services. THAT WHYS IT IS SHOWN AS IRREGULAR."
