Relying on a simple Al-Jazeera article that contains no proof whatsoever other than empty Houthi claims INSTEAD of official data cannot be deemed differently than vandalism. Moreover as an Iranian you are hardly neutral in this dispute given the Saudi Arabia-Iran proxy war. I as a Italian am neutral on the other hand.
