Pork is forbidden in the same manner as the flesh of carnivores. Among Muslims, at least, the pig is considered an unclean, repulsive animal that is unhealthy to consume -likely a biproduct/cultural explanation of its prohibition. In short, in no is pork considered as a form of 'pleasure' to deny oneself as an act of 'self-discipline' or sacrifice."
