2019-01-07T09:00:10+00:00,877219057,877205766,1,Peterjack1,Interstate 87 (New York),I-787 and I-587 are in NO WAY major junctions; they aren't very long and 587 isn't even a highway and is like a mile long. Lets stick with highways that either go long distances or are important connections. 11 junctions is fine; only one of them takes up more than two lines.
