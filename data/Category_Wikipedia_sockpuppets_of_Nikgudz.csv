2021-09-14T12:42:19+00:00,1044282432,1044251014,1,Nikgudz,Nemanja Vidić,"Go to Serbian national football team and you will find 2 or 3 UEFA sources. Unfortunatelly one of them is dead, but I know what was explained there, and it is the same like in Serbian sources. You are doing something wrong because UEFA cleaned some history articles from the website."
2021-09-13T22:01:47+00:00,1044163166,1044128215,1,Nikgudz,Savo Milošević,"I have no idea why it is separated on Wikipedia, probably for visual clarity. Other national teams that have a discontinuity with SFRY have separated caps and goals (Slovenia, Croatia, BiH, Montenegro and North Macedonia) and that is OK, but Serbia, as the only successor of SFRY, FRY and SCG in sports, represents one national team with no separation of caps and goals. I don't know why it's so much of a problem to accept that fact."
