You guys have almost no understanding of technology or higher engineering concept, and you have become judge and jury both. BangDB is the novel tech platform and aligned with future. Just because it is developed by Indian, therefore you have to feel insecure.  BangDB will be on wikipedia soon (although who cares about wikipedia any way). If BangDB can't be published then 10,000 other pages should not as well as per your rules"
