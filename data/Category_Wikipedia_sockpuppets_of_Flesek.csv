If you don't like what is described then take it to the moderators. Like mentioned here there are already wiki pages up here about Arabized Berbers. The reason why i left the ""67%"" up is because its estimated that around 2/3 of the population is of this descent. Its not accurate but its close. I can easily pull out sources to confirm this."

""Most Arab Moroccans would be better described as Arabized Berbers. The process of assimilation began with the seventh century Arab invasion and took place mostly in the cities and costal regions. As is true in other North African countries, the principle determinant of ethnicity in Morocco is language."""
