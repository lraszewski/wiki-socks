2008-02-16T17:50:46+00:00,191888380,191886223,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,The article does nothing to back up claims of violence. The Telegraph link from 2000 is the most violent incident though more vandalism than anything. Citations were in the wrong order anyway.

2008-02-13T16:25:23+00:00,191161723,191159878,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,The event in question regarding Man City took place in front of thousands of eye witnesses. It's not research I witnessed it in person. The 2003 survey is not valid in 2008.

2008-02-13T15:53:22+00:00,191155616,191154459,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,Removed one citation as a survey that took place 5 years ago is hardly totally reliable. Tried to suggest alphabetical order on the talk page but people have just ignored it. It was fine how it was.

2008-02-13T15:36:35+00:00,191152681,191152198,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,Added alphabetical order to section title. There is still extra info but alphabetical order is the best way. The whole dispute was settled when it was just alphabetical order alone.
2008-02-13T15:33:56+00:00,191152198,191148404,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,Minor edits made not  whole section. Alphabetical order with citations seemed to settle disputes but clearly that wasn't good enough for others. Hopefully things will stay the same now
2008-02-13T14:25:48+00:00,191141138,191140536,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,Changed back again. Alphabetical order is the way to display this to avoid order disputes. There are citations available and discussion page for the more detailed stuff.
2008-02-13T14:21:46+00:00,191140486,191122893,1,Brfc97,Blackburn Rovers F.C.,It's not neccessary. If it is written in any particular order it will keep getting changed eiether by myself or someone else. Alphabetical order is the correct way to go
