2006-12-28T03:08:48+00:00,96862757,96826000,1,Recoome,Freeza Saga,/* Major characters */  Frieza is the main characters in the Frieza Saga.
2006-12-28T03:06:57+00:00,96862466,96824370,1,Recoome,Namek Saga,/* Major characters */  Recoome had more of a role in the Namek saga than the other members of the Ginyu Force.
2006-12-28T03:03:58+00:00,96862032,96825110,1,Recoome,Ginyu Saga,/* Major characters */  Reverted because The Ginyu Force are the main characters in the Ginyu saga.
