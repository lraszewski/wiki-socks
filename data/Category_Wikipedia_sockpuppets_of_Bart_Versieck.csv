Given the (scientifically established) low likelihood of a smoker surviving to become the oldest person in the world, it seems more likely that a tobacco company 'sponsored' her late-life smoking for the positive publicity, and for this reason any claims about her 'lifelong smoking habits' should be viewed with suspicion."
