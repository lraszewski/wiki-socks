This link is from government media Al Ahram which states the Christians are approximately 10-15% not 5% which is for the whole Middle East region. Another example would be Sudan as Sudan is 5% Christian realistically Egypt has more Christians than Sudan. Link clarifies my edit of bias incorrect editors.

2021-12-24T16:21:53+00:00,1061882839,1061485373,1,MohammedEguyue25,Religion in Egypt,Copts or christians in Egypt are least 10% or in the 20 million range with most residing in Upper Egypt. Foreign researchers should not interfere with Egypts sovereignty or research as it is illegal including conducting polls and claim wrong information from polls of few as a whole reflection which is not true as Copts or Christians mostly reside in Upper Egypt and have nearly doubled in a century. Political bias incorrect information that is not true but for the region Middle East not Egypt.
