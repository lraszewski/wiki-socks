Trimingham doesn't outright say Argobba, instead he describes Ifat being ruled by a ""dynasty of Abyssinian origin"". Cerulli on the other hand, is commenting on one of the names of the Walashma possibly being of Ethiopic root. Cerulli says it is similar to an Amharic word, but makes note that in Ifat another semitic language Argobba was spoken. Both sources do not outright state the Walashma as being Argobba, so we should not make our own conclusions."
