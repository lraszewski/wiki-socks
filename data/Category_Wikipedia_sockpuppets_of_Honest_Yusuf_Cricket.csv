The way you called sources seems a desperate attempt to discredit content."

Also yes, the same would go for Greta Gerwig if that happens. No actor or entertainment celebrity should be given a literal teaching class with no actual qualification and with personal feelings and political viewpoints as their central topic of your lecture at a university that is not even specialized in that, that's a clear abuse of your influencing position and status."
