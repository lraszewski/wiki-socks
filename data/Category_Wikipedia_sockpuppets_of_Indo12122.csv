Muslim rule vanished a century before the Britishers even arrived. And what do you mean by higher source? I used 1 contemporary eye witness as a source and jadunath sarkaar along with tabakat i nasiri and firishta as well as Nicholas manucci. What else do you need? And we have already took this to the talk page and no one even responded.

Your own article says that this claim is highly unreliable and Romila thappar and Audrey Truschke clearly call this claim false as well. So stop this vandalism.

I have used contemporary citations even the citations of jadunath. Thirdly change this to invasion. Because it was never a permanent conquest. And hindu reconquest did take place which you didnt even mention.
