Reason: In the Wikipedia article on the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the word 'xenophobic' is never used to describe the rebellion. However, the word 'anti-imperialist' is used multiple times and is referenced. People in China rebelled against colonial influence from outside powers; that makes the rebellion anti-imperialist foremost, perhaps xenophobic tangentially. Please verify and assess this change yourself by reading the Boxer Rebellion article."
