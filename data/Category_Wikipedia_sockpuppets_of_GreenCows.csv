Why change Texian to Texian immigrant? Texian is a well defined term whereas Texian immigrant would imply an immigrant from Texas.

I question the need for detailed sentences on which countries voted against or abstained in certain years given the detailed table directly below. It seems redundant.
2022-11-05T09:35:27+00:00,1120132075,1120058927,1,GreenCows,Yemeni civil war (2014–present),/* War crime accusations */Restored a paragraph since this report covers accusation against all parties.

2022-11-03T19:44:42+00:00,1119855909,1119855426,1,GreenCows,Menachem Begin,Decided to remove this as it's undue for the first paragraph. A quote from British Documents and being banned from entering the UK isn't important enough to mention here.
2022-11-03T19:41:54+00:00,1119855426,1119854247,1,GreenCows,Menachem Begin,/* Herut opposition years */Copyedit. Added important part of the quote since the organization was disbanded at that time.
2022-11-03T19:34:05+00:00,1119854247,1105889751,1,GreenCows,Menachem Begin,Copyedit. Clarified the wording per source. It's unnecessary to mention twice in the first paragraph that he was the head of the group. Begin being banned from entering the UK in the 1950s is also probably not important enough for the first paragraph.
