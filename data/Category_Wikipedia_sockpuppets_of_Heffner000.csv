2021-06-04T11:38:51+00:00,1026813875,1026813010,1,Bobby690,EZTV,1) It is not defunt as that is what it means by 'hostile takeover'. It was taken over and a new one was not made but the domain was changed. 2) The new group does own the brand as EZTV is ranked in pretty much all lists as one of the most popular and visited torrent sites and whenever it is mentioned the history of takeover is also mentioned.

2021-05-21T04:41:41+00:00,1024275037,1024227893,1,Bobby690,Cr1TiKaL,1) variations are not needed in introduction as they are already in infobox. 2) You said in your edit revert than penguinz0 is not well known even though i have told you multiple times that more people search for penguinz0 than Cr1TiKaL. 3) MonsterCr1TiKaL is not another one of his names it's just something he said as a joke in that video because the person read the donation from MoistCr1TiKaL as MonsterCr1TiKaL. Bro this is honesty getting pathetic.

2021-05-20T15:23:11+00:00,1024176043,1024146056,1,Bobby690,Cr1TiKaL,He has never said that penguinz0 is not his alias. The only thing he has said is that he started going by Cr1TiKaL when he changed his xbox gamer tag. So if anything penguinz0 is his former alias.
2021-05-20T05:23:07+00:00,1024111732,1023933343,1,Bobby690,KSI,He has confirmed this multiple times.
2021-05-20T04:07:21+00:00,1024105051,1024069762,1,Bobby690,Cr1TiKaL,I didn't say it was his online alias i said that he's also known as penguinz0 which is what the section of the infobox is for. Also if you do a simple google trends comparison you will know that more people search for penguinz0 rather than Cr1TiKaL.

It's not a temporary career as he has not announced his retirement and always states in his videos that he's training and wants to fight jake paul so it's an ongoing career. Also check the articles of other youtube boxers like the pauls.
