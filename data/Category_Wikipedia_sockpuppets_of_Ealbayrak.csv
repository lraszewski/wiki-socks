Esra Albayrak forwarded the e-mails to her husband Berat, who is a minister. In other words, Esra Albayrak's e-mail account was not hacked. She chose to share the documents with a third party who was not even affiliated with UC Berkeley. According to your explanation, the FERPA protection over Mahmood's e-mails because they were obtained from the student's e-mail account should be irrelevant. Is that correct? Also, Esra Albayrak is a public figure who was serving on boards of major  national organizations at the time. I would be happy to write a brief biographical entry on her if you think that would be helpful. Once again, thank you so much!"

If you could clearly explain what is ""speculative"" in this objective (whatever that means) description of the contents of a primary source, I would be delighted to revise it.

Please do not hesitate to write if you need a reading list.

To many Turkish scholars suffering under the Erdogan regime and their allies, as well as others in the Middle East, this issue is immensely important--not because it shows Mahmood's personal politics but rather because it demonstrates the concrete forms her line of thinking can take. Hence we perceive the event as part of her heritage. Also, to clarify, the citation is not from a student e-mail. It is from an e-mail by a professor. As far as I know, FERPA actually discourages professors from sending information concerning educational records via e-mail since they can be accessed by third parties, legally and illegally. (http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/grades_by_email.htm) Can you recommend sources that explicitly state all e-mails by professors to students are protected under FERPA?"

The ongoing debates on social media venues after Mahmood's death show that this issue is not off-topic at all. The paragraph only cites the text and gives the context, and says nothing libelous about Mahmood's character, politics or the quality of her work. Nor does the paragraph use the illegally obtained material as evidence to make any such claim. If citing material protected by FERPA is against the Wikipedia rules, I would kindly ask the users to cite the relevant rule instead of making libelous, speculative, smearing, and bizzare claims about my user profile or the text."
