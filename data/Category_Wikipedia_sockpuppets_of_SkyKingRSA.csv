2023-09-07T19:32:40+00:00,1174328395,1174291245,1,SkyKingRSA,User talk:SkyKingRSA,Removed PoV from article. Got reversed without proper review. Got banned for challenging the decision.
2023-09-07T14:17:56+00:00,1174288264,1174283349,1,SkyKingRSA,Solidarity (South African trade union),Re-removed dramatisation of historical events and information based on opinion. Keep the article factual without use of exaggeration. History is factual.
2023-09-07T14:13:48+00:00,1174287783,1174284645,1,SkyKingRSA,Apartheid,Added content relevant to post-apartheid South Africa and in line with the information supplied on the legacy of apartheid on the social and economic standing of current day South Africa. This information also ads context to the contrast of pre and post Apartheid South Africa.
2023-09-07T13:45:22+00:00,1174284395,1174229632,1,SkyKingRSA,Apartheid,Additional information added to the post apartheid transformation of South Africa.
2023-09-07T13:31:57+00:00,1174282974,1174282209,1,SkyKingRSA,Solidarity (South African trade union),Removed biased and opinion driven links that are not factual and neutral towards the information contained.
2023-09-07T13:24:12+00:00,1174282209,1171058263,1,SkyKingRSA,Solidarity (South African trade union),Removed non-factual text and overly dramatisation of historical information. The link used from ICTUR is biased in favour of the current South African political regime and not factual reporting. A unions co-operation with a government does not confirm the views of that government. It is a unions purpose to represent two sides of a coin and negotiate on behalf of its members.
2023-09-07T12:52:31+00:00,1174278586,1174198999,1,SkyKingRSA,Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging,"No factual evidence of Neo-Nazi association or claims of ties from the party. DW documentary interview with AWB party secretary stated clearly the party is a Christian movement whereas Nazism is a non-religious organisation wherein the state is the only ""religion"""
2023-09-06T19:34:11+00:00,1174170459,1173841452,1,SkyKingRSA,Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging,"The AWB is not a Neo-Nazi political party. They do not: ""regularly display Nazi symbols and express admiration for Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders.""\n\nThe NY Times and CNN is not an authority on South African politics and have on several occasions reported incorrectly on foreign politics."
2023-09-06T19:21:40+00:00,1174168740,1164692572,1,SkyKingRSA,Great Trek,"/* Political impact */The Great Trek has zero connection to the South African Apartheid policies as the timeline is vastly different and connecting the immigration of a ethnic group with decades later implementation of political policies is not viable. For example, the exploration of the American West cannot be connected to the Jim Crow laws."

2023-07-24T14:36:37+00:00,1166911470,1166271882,1,SkyKingRSA,Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging,Corrected description of the party. It was incorrectly stated that the party is neo-nazi due to the party flag similarity. This is a common misconception as the AWB flag actually represents three sevens and not the swastika.
