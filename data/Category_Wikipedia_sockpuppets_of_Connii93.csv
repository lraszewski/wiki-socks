Allmusic.com isn’t accurate & it’s poorly sourced. It’s not a biography by Andy Kellman. Here’s the link to mixed chicks official site: https://mixedchicks.net/hair-stories/mixed-chicks-presents-hair-story-series-victoria-monet/  There are even quotes from what Victoria Monet said about her own ethnicity, she’s mixed & proud."
