This album doesn't have anything black metal in it and no Venom albums have had anything to do with black metal. Venom only came up with the name for it. They have nothing to do with black metal, they're simply just traditional NWOBHM and no different than Motorhead or Judas Priest. If you call Venom a black metal band, that's like calling Judas Priest thrash metal."

Venom still created that sound with their fast-paced guitar work and aggressive tone. It's brashness is equivalent to a casual thrash metal song. The raw power and fierce velocity alone makes this album ""OG-thrash""."
