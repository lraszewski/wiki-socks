It would be more accurate to say that the [[Puss in Boots (franchise)|Puss in Boots franchise]] is a spin-off off this one and should be split away like [[The Scorpion King (film series)]] was split from [[The Mummy (franchise)]], given the lack of crossover characters other than Puss himself, but with the reports of a Shrek cameo in the upcoming sequel we can hold off on that for a while."

That’s why she doesn’t have a character poster and is not in any of the marketing. Hebe Beardsall also reprises her role as [[Ariana Dumbledore]] from [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2|Part 2]], who can also be seen in the Chinese trailer."

Here are two references to it. I would imagine so they can market it as a fresh start like the fourth Fast & Furious film just being called that."

The working title of Expend4bles was A Christmas Story, people reported oon this and thuoght it was a spin-off, but it really was not, just the fourth film, with Statham now as the lead. Stallone has a minor role."
