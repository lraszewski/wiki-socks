They're using A2s in that image because they're using rifles from HMS Albion's armoury. (Royal Navy don't need A3s) On operations or most other land bases exercises, they'll be using A3s from Royal Marines camps' armoury. Here you can see a RM Commando with an SA80A3 in Belize 2019; https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/royal-marines-train-in-belize/ P.S the corps don't use the carbine L22 versions, they're for tank crew/pilots. Hope this helps."
