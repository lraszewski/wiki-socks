Being of Berber ancestry (and also for some Nafricans due to Vandals and colonial influence Western European ancestry) does not make North African Arabs any less Arab. There are Arab tribes who are very different in ancestry, and why specifically single out genetic Berbers from their Arab identity in this case?"
