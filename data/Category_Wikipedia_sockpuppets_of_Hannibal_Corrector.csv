However, the article for quarterback sacks has 32 players with at least 100 official sacks. This is explained by Elvis Dumervil's play this past 2017-18 NFL season. He acquired 6.5 sacks (via https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DumeEl20.htm), which put him over 100 sacks on the season, which made him #32 on the list."
