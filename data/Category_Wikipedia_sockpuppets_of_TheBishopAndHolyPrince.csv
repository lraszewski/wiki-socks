2024-03-01T23:07:01+00:00,1211318240,1208008043,1,TheBishopAndHolyPrince,Foreign Secretary,"The article must refer to his professional title rather than his previous name. There is no other exception, so far as can be seen, for any other peer not to be referred professionally (which the Foreign Secretary article is) by their title. It is disrespectful not to have their title displayed if they have been raised to the peerage. Indeed, not having his title displayed suggests that he is just a random person notwithstanding his obvious history. The title therefore remains to be displayed."
