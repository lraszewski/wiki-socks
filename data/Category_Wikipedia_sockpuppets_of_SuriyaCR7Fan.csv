Indian Movie Stats is not entirely reliable but I have seen it being used as a source for certain other movies. Also added a prominent tracking website Cinetrak which is on par with Andhra Box Office in terms of reliability as well as the producer's own statement about the film. Madras Musings itself is not entirely reliable. Therefore I believe that there should be a lower limit and upper limit for the film's final gross.
