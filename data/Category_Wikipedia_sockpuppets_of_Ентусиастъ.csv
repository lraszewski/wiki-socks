Inb4, yes, the former is an extreme form of the latter but it is also viewed as a distinct form of state-political order (there's a separate article on it, after all). My suggestion is to add Putin and/or someone simillar, for example, if you want there to be a main image about authoritarianism in this article."

This is Lenin's OFFICIAL photoprotrait - way more popular that this obscure and blurry 1920 photo. Cf. Mao's and Kim Il-sun's photos in their articles - they are their official ones too.

That's the very reason of the replacement of the 7-day week with a 10-day one. For the same reason the days of the saints were replaced with secular peasant, harvest themes. For the very same reason the 7-day week was replaced in the USSR with a 5-day and then a 6-day one during the anti-religios campaign in the 1930s."
