He has been working for Chevy in their motorsports division after previously serving as a crew chief for McMurray at Ganassi and Kahne at Hendrick. Austin Hill will drive the Beard #62 in six races (both of the races at Daytona and Talladega as the team usually runs as well as the Chicago Street Course and Michigan). I think he's a perfect fit for that car as he's already a Chevy driver and is great at superspeedways!
