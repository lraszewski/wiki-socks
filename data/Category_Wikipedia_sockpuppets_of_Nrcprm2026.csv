In 2003 military officials noted no Syrian role in recruiting fighters to go to Iraq, in 2004 Syria was involved in the killing of an AQ smuggler to Iraq. State Dep report noted in 2005 over 1k fighters were arrested by Syria, trials for suspected jihadists. Noted by Abizaid, Petraeus (contradicting his own narrative), other commanders, hr activists and even jihadists."
