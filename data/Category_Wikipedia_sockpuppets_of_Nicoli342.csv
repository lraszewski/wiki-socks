Take it to the talk section if you wish to keep the paragraph.  It has already been agreed upon by several people that the source does not state what the sentence says it does.  This is a violation of sentences needing to be verifiable and must be removed.

The linking is appropriate because of the identicality of the subject matter between the main articles and the sub-sections, and topic scope of the sub-sections.
