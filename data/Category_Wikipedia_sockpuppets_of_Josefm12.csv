Regarding the incident with Qadhi's former student, I suggest someone edits the information to mention the other controversies addressed in the article (other sources also mention this, copy the article title and search sources without paywalls) where he mentioned cutting the hands off thieves, his recorded speeches preaching promoting the stoning of adulters and killing homosexuals, etc.
