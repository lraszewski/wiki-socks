2022-07-26T18:03:26+00:00,1100588172,1100553978,1,TheLastOfTheGiants,History of Romania,"Not fringe. There are 3 modern sources mentioning this, only 1 of which is Romanian. Possibly Hungarian histography vehemently disagrees (nationalist debates), but that doesn't make it fringe. Hungarian histography disagreess on a lot of other sources such as Russian Primary Chronicle and Gesta Hungarorum, doesn't mean the ones who argue in favor are fringe."

Given the context of the Second Vienna Award, the important information was the population of North Transylvania during the Second Vienna Award, meaning in 1940, not one year later following known migration of Hungarians inside North Transylvania and Romanains outside North Transylvania. It's dishonest, like presenting Karellia's population in Finland 1 year after USSR annexed it and many Finns left and many Russians came in."

There is a Hungarian estimation made in 1940. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vienna_Award#Statistics The numbers changed from 37/38% to 53.5% Hungarians because of Romanian leaving North Transylvania and Hungarians migrating towards North Transylvania after the Second Vienna Award. The Hungarian census from 1941 is already present in the article, however the most relevant data is the population at the moment of the annexation, not 1 year after following population movement."

As far as I know, there are no speculations radically different from this one on the population of Transylvania during WW1. If you have another source with radically different speculation a case could be made for lack of academic consensus. But as it stands right now, this speculation is very similar with the Austro-Hungarian census in 1910 and the Romanian census in 1919. With the other changes I agree."
