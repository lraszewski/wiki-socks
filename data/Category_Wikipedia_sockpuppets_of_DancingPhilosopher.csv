Old explanation broke it into a non-existent prefix “нав” and a non-existent root “здогін”, with translations that were made to match word translation, not the word components. New version breaks the word down more consistently, with only the prefix “вз” being a tricky one, since it’s more of a tolerated remnant rather than a meaningful modifier in modern Ukrainian."
