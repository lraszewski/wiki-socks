2011-12-01T18:08:15+00:00,463531888,463439947,1,Ylightflight,Blood on the Dance Floor (group),I have cited electronica as being their main music genre numerous times. Do not revert it. Also Black Veil Brides did not play the same stage as BOTDF.

2011-11-26T19:52:17+00:00,462614763,462614619,1,Ylightflight,Blood on the Dance Floor (group),That article doesn't prove BOTDF is crunkcore. It lists various genres (none of which are crunkcore) that BOTDF could be considered.
