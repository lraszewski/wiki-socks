2020-08-15T02:11:56+00:00,973041416,972965048,1,Sapah3,Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia,The way this has been written is incorrect because that is not what the study says. Not to mention that groups that have notable East and Southeast Asian admixture like Bengalis are not mentioned in the study but we know that they have higher East and Southeast Asian admixture compared to other South Asian groups. The thing is the Mundas and the Tobeto-Burman speakers were included in the study so we know their results. Re-worded.
