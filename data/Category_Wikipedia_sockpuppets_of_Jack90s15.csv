Halder did not lay the foundation he acted on orders from Hitler or in the ""working towards the Fuher"" indirect way. Even disregarding Hitler, Himmler, Reinhard, Keital, and may others laid more foundations than Halder. What is current written accurately conveys the crimes and cover ups by Halder, this sentence is unneeded. If you disagree lets go the talk page."
