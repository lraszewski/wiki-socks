It is important to include all aspects of a subject in an encyclopedia, including the subjects awards and distinctions (if any). Other institution pages also have an awards and rankings section.

The description of each academy's course offerings should be kept, because it gives information about the courses taken in each academy, just as how an institution would give certain courses to students with certain majors, and that's definitely encyclopedic. I also moved the rankings to a new section of the page called Awards, Rankings & Distinctions."
