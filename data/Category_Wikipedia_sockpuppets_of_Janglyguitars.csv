Synth-pop, though not as accurate a descriptor as disco, is closer, so I've added another source for it in place of the wrongly attributed 'new wave'. If disagreement persists, I am willing to discuss this further on the talk page if others will engage."

In the UK, new wave as a term was only used in the late 70s, contemporaneously with punk, to describe bands like Joy Division, The Jam, and Buzzcocks. In America, new wave was an 80s term, but not in Britain. From an historical perspective it is more accurate to describe Joy Division as new wave and New Order as post-punk."

Why can't you accept that you're wrong and your view is overly simplistic?

Wikipedia itself describes it as a ""derivative form"" of various genres (new wave, disco, etc.) and a ""distinct genre"" rather than a ""subgenre"" of any one genre, besides the one instance in the lead on this page, and later on when it notes that ""In the US, [...] synth-pop is considered a subgenre of new wave"".

The RS piece from 83 says it's been called new wave and new music variously - no reason to use the term that refers more often to guitar acts and would exclude most synth-pop. Simon Reynolds says new music included new wave like Costello and the Pretenders + other genres, Cateforis says it replaced new wave in 83. Also based on how UK sources define new wave saying ""British new wave artists"" is totally inaccurate from their perspective, and according to lots of US critics."

'New Wave' shouldn't even be listed here at all - it was a movement of the late 70s and very early 80s, when Joy Division, not New Order, were around. No English person called New Order 'new wave' during the 80s - new wave was over by then. They were post-punk, techno-pop, electro rock, you name it, but 'new wave' is just wrong."
2023-12-25T04:10:24+00:00,1191696117,1191527493,1,Jinglyjangle,Marquee Moon,"He's right. Marquee Moon was recorded in 1976, so by any reasonable chronology it's not 'post-punk'. New Wave existed alongside punk in the mid-late 70s while post-punk came after punk (hence the name), so to say this influenced 'new wave' in the 80s while being a 'post-punk' record from early 1977 is incoherent."
