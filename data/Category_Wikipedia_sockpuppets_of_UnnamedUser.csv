Unfortunately just adding ""who"" to ""died in office"" wouldn't fix it, since Taylor also died in office between those dates. This is why it was phrased as it was before the big rewrite 2 weeks ago. I've tried to make it accurate but it's a bit clunkier. -- Also, added the context of the full number of died-in-office POTUSes. Removed ""younger""; ""elder"" is not mentioned."
