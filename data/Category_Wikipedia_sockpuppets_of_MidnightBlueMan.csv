The first paragraph in this page says that ""The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend"", so the American cowboy was based on the Mexican vaquero (which was based on the Spanish one), but not directly from the Spanish tradition. 2. The section is about Vaqueros, not cowboys, so it makes no sense to mention them, so I figure they were talking about peeople from the Americas."
