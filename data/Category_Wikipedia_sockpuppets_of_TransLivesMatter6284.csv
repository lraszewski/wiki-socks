Please do not mis-characterize sources, especially with respect to living figures in an attempt to slander them.   Both ""extremist"" and ""far-right"" are non-NPOV and inappropriate here."

Looking at the history, this editor has repeatedly tried to write this article in a biased manner, and has had to be corrected.  His desire to remove this sentence is appear to arise from desire to provide a one-sided picture of the subject. Citations of a subject's articles for color are the norm in all articles, and particularly necessary here, where this editor has written the article to make it appear that the subject is only criticized by ""other right-wing commentators."""

Rather, they provide a fuller picture of Haywood's activities, and such examples are universal in WP articles about writers. However, I have moved the text further down as a counterpoint to cited criticism."
