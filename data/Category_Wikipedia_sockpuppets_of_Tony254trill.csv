2010-08-15T14:38:24+00:00,379050830,379049576,1,ScottieAngelo,Kobe Bryant,1. You miss spelled disappointments. 2. Losing in the first round when your the 7th/8th seed to the 1st/2nd seed is not disappointing it is expected. 3. It was the rebuilding years for the Franchise.
2010-08-15T09:40:47+00:00,379020607,379019765,1,ScottieAngelo,Kobe Bryant,I thought to add in that he was the top high school basketball in the country.
2010-08-15T09:30:50+00:00,379019765,379019240,1,ScottieAngelo,Kobe Bryant,I changed the title to the Rebuilding Period. The title is more accurate as the Lakers were never a top seed in the playoffs those three years so losing in the playoffs wasn't really a disappointment.
2010-08-15T09:25:13+00:00,379019240,379016210,1,ScottieAngelo,Kobe Bryant,You incorporate your own feelings and opinions on the page. It doesn't say on any other NBA greats page that they lost in the NBA Finals or how many times. ALL the pages should be noted the same.
