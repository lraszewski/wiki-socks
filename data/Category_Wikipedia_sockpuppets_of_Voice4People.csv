For the terms “English” and “British”, English is used for ones ethnicity, while British is used for ones nationality.. If you’re referring to him as one of the two, it would have to more accurately be the “British” term. Raheem’s ethnicity would clearly be Jamaican as well and although it isn’t cited of any form of British citizenship, since he represents for England— “Jamaican-British” would be appropriate."
