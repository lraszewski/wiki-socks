2009-01-06T13:54:28+00:00,262302523,257903755,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,/* Fiction */ Rip 'n Roar... A new novel titled 'Unplugging Philco' set for April 2009. I wonder if it will be all about me?
2008-12-13T17:39:45+00:00,257727319,257724407,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,I think it's pretty fucking self-evident: 200 characters is better. I think we all hate it when we have to cut short our tweets. Kudos to Wikipedia for being on the bleeding edge of tweets.
2008-12-13T17:29:20+00:00,257724407,254691803,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,"Well, I sure have been twittering my little heart out. I made a comparison: u can use 200 characters if u tweet at Wikipedia but u can only use 140 characters if u tweet at Twitter. Which is better?"
2008-11-28T23:39:42+00:00,254691803,254691381,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,"Anyhow, I'm going to go meet up with some friends now and have a few drinks. Actually, I should probably get something to eat beforehand. I'm famished."
2008-11-28T23:36:52+00:00,254691381,254691298,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,Us sensitive types do not censor ourselves.
2008-11-28T23:36:16+00:00,254691298,254691163,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,Let me tell you I am very much a sensitive type. I am given to flying off the handle at the slightest slight. And I will damn well read Céline if I want to. Do you hear me?!?!
2008-11-28T23:35:25+00:00,254691163,254691051,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,Knipfel warns sensitive types not to read Céline or suggests it. What's the difference?
2008-11-28T23:34:37+00:00,254691051,254690914,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,This essay is encyclopedic in some ways. Maybe Knipfel has it in him to write a Wikipedia article after all. Not an easy task I tell you. You have to deal with delinquents.
2008-11-28T23:33:47+00:00,254690914,253788612,1,Deathdestroyer,Jim Knipfel,"/* Selected bibliography */ Alright, I'm bringing yet another Knipfel essay to all of you! ""Reading Louis-Ferdinand Céline"". Whatever... Céline appears to be an acquired taste."
