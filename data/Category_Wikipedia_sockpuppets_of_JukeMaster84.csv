I completely agree the point that ""typeface"" can sound a bit pretentious, but it makes sense for talking about a multi-style font family, which Times New Roman is. Also, in metal type, a font often means a consignment of metal type (e.g. ""the printing shop had one 10pt font and another 12 pt font"")"
