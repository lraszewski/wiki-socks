The MG36 cannot be considered as a squad automatic weapon since it hasn't been adopted for that role. Hence the right category for it is a light machine gun. A more correct way to refer to it is 'an automatic rifle'.
2023-04-30T01:35:40+00:00,1152404787,1152242859,1,Guns_&_Glory,Heckler & Koch G36,The reason why I used the redirect to the HK416A5 variant is because the G95A1 comes from that variant and not the original HK416. The A5 configuration can simply swap handguards and trigger group to reconfigure it to the G95A1 specs. But the original HK416.
