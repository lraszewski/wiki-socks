2010-10-22T18:21:15+00:00,392258852,392229777,1,Alan8746,General circulation model,But the average values being computed are still only estimates (and with errors that accumulate with each iteration of the model).
2010-10-22T01:08:36+00:00,392134233,392077790,1,Marvin1292,General circulation model,Calculate alone implies an unwarranted level of accuracy and precision.  The quantities being calculated are only estimates for a finite set of variables.

2010-10-22T21:02:06+00:00,392285825,392283877,1,The_great_sluggo,General circulation model,You know perfectly well what the point is.  Please try to be constructive rather than obstructive in terms of improving the article.  How's this?  Suggest an alternative?
2010-10-22T20:45:07+00:00,392283171,392282386,1,The_great_sluggo,General circulation model,Good points.  Better now?
2010-10-22T20:38:03+00:00,392282024,392273849,1,The_great_sluggo,General circulation model,The reader should be aware that the initial conditions are artificial.
