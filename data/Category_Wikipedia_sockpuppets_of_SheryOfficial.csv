So the photograph is of a very small denomination with pretty extreme views, and the photograph is next to a paragraph that doesn't mention them at all. Since the photo shows a minority position, but the text describes all Christians in general, I think the juxtaposition of the two is misleading to readers. If someone wants to add information about the photo that would be fine, but otherwise I don't think it works here in this article. Thanks"

The same isn't the case for the Sunni faction.\n\nHence the aforesaid phrase was modified to reduce ambiguity and maintain the sharing of authentic information."

Also added square brackets around ‚ÄúBassel‚Äù and ‚ÄúBashar‚Äù in the quotation because, in the cited article, the two are spelled ‚ÄúBasil‚Äù and ‚ÄúBachar‚Äù, respectively. So, there were two options I saw: Make the quotation exact or use the spellings already used elsewhere in the article in square brackets. I chose the latter as I think it is more consistent and will lead to less reader confusion."
