2023-08-01T07:24:27+00:00,1168180267,1168179902,1,Khan_Of_Naral,Swati tribe,Firstly Swatis never claimed to be Dravidians. It was also a propaganda by some other tribes which this report rejected. Secondly This Report didn't mention anywhere that the Swatis shares highest affinity to neighbors of Indus Valley. Please write citations with care.
2023-08-01T07:17:47+00:00,1168179643,1168179190,1,Khan_Of_Naral,Swati tribe,Weird history written. They used to spoke this and this? What is the purpose of writing this thing here. Many Castes used to speak languages of other ethnic groups. Like Swatis are speaking Hindko in majority now a days which is Indo Aryan Language. The thing which matter is What they speaking presently. Swatis are speaking Hindko and Pashto since 1500s. It had been 600 years !!!!!!!! Stop mentioning they spoke this and what.

Kohistanis are low caste while Gabris are high caste and Still today Gabris speak Pashto. 0% gabri speak Kohistani. Don't mix Gabri with Gawri. Both are two different terms. It's an propaganda by Indians to prove Swatis of Indian origin in which they can never be successful. I warn Indians to stop make changes to our articles otherwise There will be a war !

If you can't read Urdu then don't ask for reference. That was just a translation of Word Garhi Habibullah in Urdu. I know now you will put me in socket puppetry as I have read your history. You trick people and many people blamed you for that so yes You might be one of them. I can see your edits on Swati tribe page too
2023-09-19T19:16:07+00:00,1176143282,1176142825,1,Knightwithsword,Garhi Habibullah,I will just say stop being dumb and follow the Swatiwali with us as your ancestors did.   Khankhail is just a subsection of Swati tribe just like other sections. Never try to consider yourself superior because Every Swati have same blood in its veins. Other Sections made Saadaat Khan chief because he was a great man not superior. This thing is drowning you people. Khankhails were our brothers and still they are. The Word Swati is incomplete without Khankhails so it was not my hate but anger
2023-09-19T19:09:28+00:00,1176142473,1175933123,1,Knightwithsword,Garhi Habibullah,Listen brother We are not jealous of you people infact we loved you people much than anyone but It was mistake by the new generation of you people who tried who wrote themselves superior and having Qureshi claims. Infact We know Khankhails are real Gabris who came with us from Swat. This Qureshi thing is just a propaganda whether propagated by other Swatis or Khankhails themselves. 2nd thing Every Khankhail used to write Swati in his tribe in domicile and land revenue record.

2023-09-10T19:42:14+00:00,1174803869,1174803468,1,NawabOfTanawal,Karnol,who said Hujras are considered in famous sites. I have never seen this much self promotion before. Further the royal Nawabs of Tanawal didn't precieve themselves superior to any other human and these little mountanious landords of 20 kanal which worth some lacs in total are considering themselves superior So shame for you all
2023-09-10T19:38:46+00:00,1174803468,1174803329,1,NawabOfTanawal,Karnol,There was no ruler of Pakhli this is just self made history written in gazetters which were written by Britishers for their loyal puppets
2023-09-10T19:37:20+00:00,1174803329,1174803156,1,NawabOfTanawal,Karnol,These villages were not founded in last 3 centuries but these villages have people living since 1000 of years
2023-09-10T19:35:46+00:00,1174803156,1174803082,1,NawabOfTanawal,Karnol,having lands in mountains is not feudalism
2023-09-10T19:34:59+00:00,1174803082,1174425107,1,NawabOfTanawal,Karnol,one more un-referenced article. Khans of Garhi have not much historically importance and here new self created Khans can be found. I have to laugh for next 1 month I guess
2023-09-10T19:30:58+00:00,1174802574,1174801431,1,NawabOfTanawal,Garhi Habibullah,Ruler of Pakhli? Half of Pakhli is Agror which had their own Ruler and Chief of Swati since 1712. Begal Mitravi Swatis are ruling Agror since then of which the first ruler was brother in law of Nawab of Tanawal. Most part of Pakhli was Yaghistan means idependent area which British even never conquered and that was ruled by Arsala Khan Malkal swati and his ancestors who was made Sardar by Swatis of Yaghistan. If you really wanna see royalty then goto Agror or Battagram.
2023-09-10T19:23:29+00:00,1174801431,1174799540,1,NawabOfTanawal,Garhi Habibullah,"Undid revision 1174799171 by [[Special:Contributions/24.211.70.219|24.211.70.219]] ([[User talk:24.211.70.219|talk]]) You can't defend a un-referenced history, Further I know who were real Chiefs of Swati. Have you heard about Arsala Khan He was Chief made by Swatis not by britishers. Read Gazzeteer for informition about Khan of Allai Arsala Khan"
2023-09-10T19:08:57+00:00,1174799540,1174799171,1,NawabOfTanawal,Garhi Habibullah,Further Local Khans are not considered Royals. There were approximately 20+ Khanates in Mansehra and Battagram of different Swati clans. Khans were just landlords not rulers. Further Khans of Garhi were given title of Chief of Swatis by British empire which is nothing to be proud of but it's shame. Khan Bahadur title was given to those who were puppets of Britishers. If you want t see a state then come to Tanawal and watch a palace.Calling yourself rulers and have Dewri built on Shamlat.
