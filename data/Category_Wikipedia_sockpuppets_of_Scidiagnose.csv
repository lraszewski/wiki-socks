The instrument used to measure the atmospheric pressure is called barometer.  Two types of barometers are in use for this purpose ."

The temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid on heating at normal atmospheric pressure is called the melting point of that solid.

If the substance is solid, the constant temperature at which the substance changes from solid state to liquid state at normal atmospheric pressure is called melting point of the given solid. For example, the melting point of wax is 60 ° C which means that the wax is converted from its solid state to liquid state at the temperature of 60 ° C."

Principle: This process is based on the difference in adsorption of constituents by a surface of an appropriate adsorbent material or solid medium (stationary phase).  The rate of adsorption of a particular constituent depends upon its solubility in the solvent (moving phase) and its affinity for the adsorbing m
