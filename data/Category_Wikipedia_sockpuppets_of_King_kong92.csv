At least, there is no clear date on when it might have erupted, if it ever did. Most sources say there was igneous activity during the Early Jurassic on the Hill, whereas others state there was activity in Late Cretaceous/Early Neogene when Australia broke away from Antarctica. They seem to be contradicting. So alas, we have to leave out some 'absolute' content regarding dates and eras."
