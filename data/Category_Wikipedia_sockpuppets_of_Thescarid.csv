I see you caught a spelling mistake too, good for you and us. You can add the references if you want or enter anindication that the reference is needed. Also please check the  sentence following (terminal phase) It is a fractured sentence and doesn't make sense. Your comments are quite esoteric and since you haven't published anything about these fish it seems curious that you want to revert edits that haven't been mad by you. Bonne continuation"
