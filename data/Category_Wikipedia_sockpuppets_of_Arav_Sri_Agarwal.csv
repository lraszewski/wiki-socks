2019-10-18T10:45:59+00:00,921857742,921770337,1,Arav_Sri_Agarwal,Konaseema,I added a section about Dindi and referenced a YouTube video that described it as the heart of Konaseema in order to add more information about Konaseema and the regions present in it. I also corrected a variety of grammatical errors and improved the language utilized here. I also supported the wonderful idea of having a section to appreciate our fellow contributors!
