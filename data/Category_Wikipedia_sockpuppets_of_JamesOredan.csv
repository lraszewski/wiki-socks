2019-04-25T13:53:31+00:00,894076740,894075967,1,Liberty_Wealth,Al-Andalus,"Rule means predominance, Muslims did not dominate the Peninsula for 8 centuries. From the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (and even before) the majority of Iberia was Christian. And for a long time there was only the Emirate of Granada, which remained vassal of Castile until 1492. The scholars use ""Rule"" to the Muslim period in Iberia before the Taifa system."

Confusion reduced by avoiding the term when possible, given its ambiguity and the vast difference(s) between e.g. Ferrarese and Italian of Ferrara. We can discuss this in Talk, if you wish."

I also removed an unreliable and unneeded source. The author does not have any academic qualifications related to the study of history. Publisher is not selective and publishes all manner of material (incl. fringe stuff like parapsychology) and the book seems to push fringe theories. Books by the same publisher have been deemed unreliable on other WP articles before.
