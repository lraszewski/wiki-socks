As far as I can see, it's just that it lists more dialects for Kumaoni than for Garhwali, but that does not mean that one has more variation than the other (it could easily be that one language has fewer, but more divergent dialects).  Anyway, this is a statement that I recall seeing in the literature, so might as well stay without a ref for now: not controversial"
