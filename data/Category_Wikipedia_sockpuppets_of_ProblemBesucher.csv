2019-06-21T16:39:47+00:00,902840025,902838352,1,ProblemBesucher,Trial of Michael Jackson,I changed this sentence because it seemd onesided. In the infamous film scene he did not defend sleeping in the same bed as children. He uses the phrase ''sharing a bed'' but elaborates exactly on what he means by it: he gives his bed to someone else and he would sleep on the floor. Which does not seem half as crazy if you consider that his ''room'' was the size of an appartment. Using a incriminating phrase even though in the same sentence this phrase is explained seems biased.

2019-06-21T16:08:39+00:00,902836593,902786465,1,ProblemBesucher,Trial of Michael Jackson,The previous version catered to a popular believe Jackson ''bought silence''. it is important to note that the evidence for the criminal case back then was examined by two grand juries and found not sufficient to even indict. This should be made clear because the 1993 allegations are used to support following claims. The settlement was for a civil claim of negligence. It did not affect criminal prosecutions.
