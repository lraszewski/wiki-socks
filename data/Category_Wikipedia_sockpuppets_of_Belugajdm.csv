2023-09-03T17:29:14+00:00,1173640163,1173639472,1,Shariglaze,Little China (ideology),"“Thần châu” means “godly kingdom,” this is simply descriptive term they used for their kingdom. This is not the same as identifying as “China.”"
2023-09-03T17:25:04+00:00,1173639472,1173636592,1,Shariglaze,Little China (ideology),1. Lý Văn Phức is not a Việt ruler; he is a mandarin of Chinese descent 2. Being influenced by Chinese culture does not mean a country is “China.” 3. This was written in an attempt to justify why Việts should not labeled “barbarians.”
2023-09-03T17:09:01+00:00,1173636592,1173635645,1,Shariglaze,Little China (ideology),"Again, These rulers don’t think of themselves and their countries as “China.” Please do not impose the English word and equate it to the Chinese word. In Chinese the title “Zhong Guo” means Central/Balance/Righteous/admittance Kingdom. These rulers use the term as a positive descriptive name for their kingdoms. E.g so, “our Righteous Kingdom” etc."
2023-09-03T17:03:43+00:00,1173635645,1173634410,1,Shariglaze,Little China (ideology),"Whoever made this article seem to not be familiar with Sinitic languages and its influence. These rulers don’t think of themselves and their countries as “China,” the nation-state. as in the English word. In Chinese the title “Zhong Guo” means Central/Balance/Righteous/admittance Kingdom - it’s used as descriptive name for their kingdoms."
2023-09-03T16:56:44+00:00,1173634410,1173629663,1,Shariglaze,Little China (ideology),This is disingenuous. The title Vương affirms Đại Việt’s independence.
