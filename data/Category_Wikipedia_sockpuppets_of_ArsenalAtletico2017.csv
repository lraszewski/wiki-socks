This article is about the group ""Caucasian"" which includes europeans. In a section about causian ""traits"", it doesn't make a lot of sense to distiguish between members of the same group. Like having a ""Traits"" section in the article on ""Squares"" mention color. It is an orthogona concept and not useful for distinguishing from non-members of the group. (Artificial as it may be) Move to European I guess."
