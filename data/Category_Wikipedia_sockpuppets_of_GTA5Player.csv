Some people also like to believe the Loch Ness monster is real. There are some people in the world who enjoy fantasies and enjoy trying to convince other people that they are real. However in reality the wisdom teeth can erupt anywhere from the ages of 14 to 19 years old depending on the person's physical development.

Any articles saying that people grow extra teeth in their 20s are unreliable.
