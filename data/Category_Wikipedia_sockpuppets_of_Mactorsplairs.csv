Also, 62% European 227% indigenous on a person shows that person is a mixed race person.

2024-01-07T09:46:40+00:00,1194124727,1194109550,1,Mactorsplairs,Colombians,PLOS is simply reaffirming other studies that state the average Colombian DNA is around 62% European 27% native and 9% African.

The same agency already conducted a separate study with Colombia’s white population and the numbers were vastly different then the ones conducted by PLOS for Colombians as a whole. Reference this here :https://rdcu.be/dvl10. Here white Colombians were shown to have 70-80% European dna. 80% of the population lives in the Andean region, meaning that a study measuring any major city from that region is more likely to grasp the average Colombian"
