Yes the Dutch would have wouldn’t have wanted French influence to spread but they also didn’t lose any territory in a war when they were attacked so there were so advantages and disadvantages for the Dutch in the resulting peace treaty so this means it should be listed as inconclusive.

Also France gave Algeria independence on its own accord not through some military defeat inflicted on France like in Indochina.

2021-05-20T18:00:06+00:00,1024198113,1024189869,1,Rebelrajan,Irish War of Independence,Sometimes wars don’t have a clear winner or loser like in this case as Ireland failed to establish a 32 county republic while Britain failed to maintain the status quo. Just leave it how it was and people can make their own assumptions about who won this war (if there even was a winner) based on the Anglo-Irish treaty.

2021-05-12T07:05:20+00:00,1022743564,1022686658,1,Rebelrajan,Irish War of Independence,It can’t be considered a complete Irish victory because a 32 county republic was not achieved only a 26 county British dominion which would later get full independence in 1937 and become a republic in 1949 still with only 26 counties but I think that the Anglo Irish treaty is a strategic political for Ireland considering it gave us the “freedom to achieve freedom”

These were not Japanese soldiers under the order of Japan (which no longer had a military), plus just months prior they overthrew the French in Vietnam, so it's disingenuous to just write ""Japan"" as if that country was behind the post-war actions by France/UK."

The Polish Ottoman War of 1633 was won by the Polish-Lithuanian forces as the Ottomans did not look for an open conflict with the recently victorious Commonwealth that won its war with Russia in the east and was now mobilising its forces on its southern flank. This is all written in the description of the war.
