2022-02-17T08:30:33+00:00,1072360301,1072338376,1,Aqww,Buyeo,"Most Korean and Western linguists at least view the language of Buyeo as similar to Korean, and it cannot be denied that Goguryeo and Baekje were also kingdoms established by the Buyeo people and were ethnically similar to Buyeo.\n\nAlso, Wikipedias of other countries such as Germany, France, Poland and Turkey view Buyeo as Korea's history."
2022-02-16T06:02:25+00:00,1072149815,1072148422,1,Aqww,Buyeo,"Current mainstream academia in the West and Korea has it that Buyeo was a Proto-Koreanic kingdom constituted by the Koreanic Yemaek tribes. The initiative that Buyeo was tungusic and distinct from Koreanic is currently a contested, unaccepted theory on line with China's Northeast Project."
