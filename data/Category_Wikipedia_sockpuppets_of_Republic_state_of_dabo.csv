Of course the true end date is debatable, but the Battle of Palmito Ranch in Texas seems better than Johnson's 9 May declaration that hostilities had 'virtually ended'.  There are later dates for consideration (e.g. the Shenandoah), so I guess it's a matter of picking a reasonable date and sticking with it consistently and explaining the other variables."
