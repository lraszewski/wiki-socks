Mentioning the bears and hippos only for their size is kinda silly, so added them in epochs when they first appeared. (Angiosperms are thought to have appeared in late Triassic according to recent molecular clocks, but lack of any fossil from that period, and even from Jurassic, prevents me to do it though I have sources.)"
