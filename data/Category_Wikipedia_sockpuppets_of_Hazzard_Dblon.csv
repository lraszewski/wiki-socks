You contradict yourself by asking me for coherent quotes, when inside ""allmusic"" there is not a single quote from a book, it is a review taken from a poor deduction without any consideration to the founders. Grindcore was created in the Birmingham underground. Punk never worked with record companies, that's why they never gave importance to their exponents."
