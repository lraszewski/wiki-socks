2009-04-04T21:12:57+00:00,281772446,281703563,1,Accor19,Bill Evans,Strange - you're obviously a real Bill Evans fan - doesn't it insult the great man's legacy to put someone's name in there who wasn't influenced by him?
2009-04-04T08:06:13+00:00,281661343,281623463,1,Accor19,Bill Evans,Will probably have to report this as a dispute. No one wants you to propagate lies about Mehldau - you obviously have some issues.
2009-04-03T22:33:27+00:00,281587432,281432334,1,Accor19,Bill Evans,"The artist himself, when he is alive, is the best authority on who influenced him. Don't you want the most verifiable, correct information on E's legacy? Or do you have a bone to pick?"

2009-03-31T21:50:47+00:00,280950138,280949569,1,Brnllndgmntz,Brad Mehldau,"/* Early career */ I have corrected the comment about the Berklee award. Mehldau was a sophmore, not a junior, and most likely was not the youngest person ever to win the award."

2009-04-06T06:24:55+00:00,282052160,281949404,1,Eidtnc,Bill Evans,"I agree with the others - especially as regards your latest 'reference'. Clearly, it's not a reference that shows how Mehldau is influenced by Evans - it's about something else. What's up, Jazzeur?"

2009-04-01T11:16:49+00:00,281057376,280973804,1,Hgldrn,Bill Evans,/* Historical impact */ Justification is incongruity of mention of Mehldau only appearing at historical impact section. I suspect bias of Jazzeur who has repeatedly tried to get M.'s name on page.
