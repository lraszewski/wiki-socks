2019-12-02T20:38:56+00:00,928967233,928839416,1,Hotbutter,Jean-Claude Juncker,"He was not President of the European Council. Misleading. The position did not exist until 2009, and the Presidency of the Council of the European Union belonged to a country and not a person. He was chair of European Council summits by virtue of Luxembourg holding the presidency."

2019-12-01T05:44:30+00:00,928719671,928717316,1,Hotbutter,European Commission,Official communiques seem to suggest VDL has dropped the office of 1st VP in favour of 3 co-equal Exec VPs. Can’t find any mention of first vp on Timmermans’ profile on new Commission. Can rvt if I’m wrong.
