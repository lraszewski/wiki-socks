Your own source says 'connects' and from this possible connections it has been drawn. Your source doesn't outright say they followed zoroastrianism. Read it again  2) Your sources mention that they are mentioned in sanskrit and pali texts so there is no issue there. 3)The Indian lands would be the Indo-aryan lands, doesn't need to be a 1:1 replica as that would be plagiarism."

If an author who had written 70+ books and has appeared on multiple news agencies including the BBC is not considered a specialist please reconsider your definition. This is a reliable source and also bases his point of view on this historical account of the ancient Greek historian Diodorus. This is also classed as vandalism as its an unconstructive edit. Please refrain from doing this in the future.
