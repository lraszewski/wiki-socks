The most recent census was in 2018 where it was determined that 87% identified themselves as non-ethnic, divided into 47% mestizo and 40% white. In addition, the PLOS genetic magazine supports that Colombians have a European inheritance greater than 62.5%, the second highest in South America after Argentina, which showed 67%. Which means that it has been identified as ""mestizo"" in Colombia can be seen as a Caucasian: European or Levantine."
