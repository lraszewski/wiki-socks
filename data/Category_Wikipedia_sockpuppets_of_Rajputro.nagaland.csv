2020-01-13T02:53:36+00:00,935524082,935522568,1,Rajputro.nagaland,Sylheti Nagri,"It is understandable to use ""Nagari"" in Wikipedia "" to relate it with other Nagari Script. It doesn't automatically implies the script's connection to only Nāgarī script but also it relates to different cities ""Nogors"". Every city has different history of language evolution but also has similarities due to common trades. There is more than 10 types of Nagri Scripts found in Sylhet Region. Different communities used to write their own languages in different scripts."
