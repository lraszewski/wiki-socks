2019-11-29T10:04:29+00:00,928460363,928458509,1,Egooq,Copts in Egypt,This is why many Journalists get arrested why because they make up information misinform people and manipulate information to make the source as newsworthy wrong info. The Wall Street and bbc are known to misinform and hide information for certain topics or news. Yes they are corrupt and I can get website links to prove it.The 5 million is what the Muslim Brotherhood estimated in 2012 during constitutional which is impossible with the help of Obama administration at the time.

2019-11-29T09:38:39+00:00,928458509,928105159,1,Lakiloep,Copts in Egypt,"Old reference articles with errors, hasn't BBC news and Wall Street journal been criticised and scrutinized for misinformation and errors? yes they have been so therefore I updated with recent reference and by State media which would be more reliable. One must understand that now it is 2019 different government and constitution amendments since 2013 and I don't think 5 million when Al ahram state news estimated 10-15%. Be cautious because there is corruption and misinformation in the media."

2020-01-16T03:35:18+00:00,936008280,936006467,1,Sami12123,Copts in Egypt,Deleted bedouin Mob incorrect according to Coptic websites. Ref 3 mentions that Copts were subjected to Jizya true but not all Copts paid the Jizya as many Copts did evade paying Jizya some did some didn't. Also Coptic websites have previously criticised that NGO's and western media spread incorrect information about Copts such as number of copts and falsified stories or some wrong information of incidents along with incorrect information about incidents.
2020-01-16T03:19:54+00:00,936006467,936005078,1,Sami12123,Copts in Egypt,Sorry Neutrality the information on Wall Street journal is incorrect never has the Egyptian government Sisi estimated 5 million for Copts in 2015 as all Egyptian media outlets acknowledge that Copts are at 10 to 20% which equates to 15-20 million. Im sure Egyptian media would be more accurate when mentioning info about people in Egypt than corrupt American media as Trump even admitted. Yes there is corruption in the Wall Street media manly from falsifying stories and disinformation. Check source
2020-01-16T03:08:00+00:00,936005078,935855156,1,Sami12123,Copts in Egypt,Copts are not 5 million that is false disinformation from Wall Street journal which is know to misinform. 1) Al Ahram government news mentions and estimates 10 - 15% which equates 15 - 20 million. Trust Egyptian media sources which also says the same and estimates Copts at 10-20%. The Wall Street Journal is known for disinformation and has come under scrutiny before for misinformation.
