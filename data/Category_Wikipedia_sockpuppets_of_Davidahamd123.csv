Mick Jagger said of the track: ""I was banging out three chords incredibly loud on the electric guitar, which isn't always a wonderful idea but was great fun here. This is a Punk meets Chuck Berry number. The lyric carries no fantastically deep message, but I think it might have had something to do with Bianca."""

I don't need any web references because it is already stated in the article that ''In the liner notes to the 1993 compilation album ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones]]'' (on which it was included), Jagger said, ""It's important to be somewhat influenced by what's going on around you and on the ''Some Girls'' album, I think we definitely became more aggressive because of the punk thing..."""
