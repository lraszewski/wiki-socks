This author has been under attack on social media, including wiki, with inaccurate and defamatory posts about the forthcoming novel, which wiki posters have not read as it hasn't been released. I have read the novel, and have accurate information."

Levy,"I added quotes from Barry scholar already quoted that show a balanced perspective, and a quote from the most recent Barry biography by Jeremy Dronfield. The current citations are one-sided, suggesting that there is only one interpretation of Barry's life and gender identity, which is incorrect. There are many interpretations, including feminist, lesbian, gender fluid, trans, and Barry as hermaphrodite. The incomplete historical record allows for a plurality of analysis of Barry's life."

I changed the line ""in keeping with Barry's life history and self image,"" as it's incorrect. Barry left no record of gender identity. See reference #14, Guardian article, w/ quote by biographer Jeremy Dronfield, who states there's evidence that Barry planned to revert to birth sex of female after medical school, but circumstances prevented that. The question of Barry's gender i.d. is open for interpretation."
