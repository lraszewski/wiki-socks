Dont just say Regina,Saskachewan, because there might be a few people that might not know where it is. Just keep it simple. Also, we know that he lived in Michigan. No need to give every detail about his childhood locations. He was born in Seoul, but moved to Canada in 1988, then to Michigan where he attended Troy high school. Also stop repeating Kalamazoo college again and again. We know that guys!"

Also, he was raised in Greensboro, North Carolina. Thats true, but we dont need to include every detail about him or his parents. If you want to give details about his parents, you should make a wikipedia page for his parents as well. This is just about him, not his parents. Its ok to mention his parent's names. But no need to include every detail about them. We all know that people!!"

He only visited his parents there. He never resided there. According to KBS interview, he stated that he never resided there, but has visited there frequently due to his parents that resided in Hawaii. He basically spent his entire life in the state of Kansas."
