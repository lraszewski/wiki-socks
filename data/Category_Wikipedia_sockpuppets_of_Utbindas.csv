2015-12-05T16:28:36+00:00,693885684,693876413,1,Victoriaa11,Dress,3 pics replaced.. reasons r:-1. in last lehenga pic upper clothing was seen mainly while lehenga is lower clothing  2. in mini-dress last pic it's men dressed as women  3. in sari old pic it's v.old woman who seems to have changed normal style of drapery.
2015-12-05T15:28:59+00:00,693878851,693859706,1,Victoriaa11,Skirt,i found atleast 3 pics of shreyoshidasgupta (SD) worth putting back ... 2 pics i.e. of lehenga and short skirt were not thr b4 SD put it (for short skirt ive found a better pic)..& the old denim skirt was too focussed on woman's butt so has been replaced.
