Your first paragraph is completely unsourced. Topicalization and focalization r not the reason Spanish sentences can be in any order. Other Romance language r also governed by the same and CANNOT be in any order (certainly not VSO) so the paragraph is gibberish. At least source your sentences if we have a point of disagreement. That is what Im doing here.
