The reference used for it actually said no such thing, and I looked up the real reference for it which was a completely different book, and it had based the claim on W. L. Moran, 1969, “New Evidence from Mari on the History of Prophecy” in the journal Biblica, volume 50, pages 15 – 56. I then went and read Moran's article, which is a translation of letters abotu temple omens. In one letter a prophecy says that Zimri-Lim is in danger and should surround himself with the councillors he loves, and Moran comments that Zimri-Lim's 'love' is a platonic love that should be compared to Hammurabi's 'love' for the temple of Marduk in the Code of Hammurabi. Long story short, absolutely nowhere is there evidence that Hammurabi had male lovers, and it seems likely that Zimri-Lim's 'love' is talking about friendhsip, not romantic or sexual love. Feel free to verify yourselves. Peace."
