2018-04-09T22:26:56+00:00,835643045,835206555,1,Hammerhard18,Amityville: The Awakening,Added two critic responses which will help wiki readers both none Horror related critics. It’s good to have a balance. It gives a diverse brush stroke and helps wiki readers.

2018-04-09T22:08:58+00:00,835640928,835423594,1,Hammerhard18,Hellraiser: Judgment,Another critic point of view. I found the opinion helpful so I think wiki readers will also find it helpful. It’s as helpful as dread central and bloody disgusting points of view and as the critics NONE horror related it’s a valid point of view. I’m not linked to the film or the critic so it’s not self promotion!
2018-04-09T21:51:51+00:00,835638701,835423515,1,Hammerhard18,Mute (2018 film),I have included two critic responses to Mute. This helps Wiki readers see the diverse reviews the film got.
2018-04-09T21:36:06+00:00,835636576,835423549,1,Hammerhard18,The Bachelors (2017 film),This is to equal out the films recepition and I am not the person and I don’t belong to the film or it’s producers and this is not a blog it offers information from a critic about the film. It fits with your guidelines perfect! I’m including it as it was helpful to me and will be to others.
2018-04-09T21:05:38+00:00,835631316,835630579,1,Hammerhard18,The Open House,Same as before I edited to fit with the layout of Wiki. As stressed before this is a review for the film and NOT a blog it’s to include a balanced critic of the NETFLIX film I am not part of Netflix or the critic or the film. So in no way is the edit self promotion!
