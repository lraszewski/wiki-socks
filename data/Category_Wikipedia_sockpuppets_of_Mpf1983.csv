2007-06-24T16:22:08+00:00,140326520,140325398,1,Mpf1983,Richard Turnbull (theologian),I've deleted this article because it has too many factual errors. Aren't people interested in truth anymore?
2007-06-24T16:19:38+00:00,140326136,140325021,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford",I've deleted this because it is a poor article.

2007-06-24T15:59:14+00:00,140322807,140322504,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford",I have done this in order to update the staff list.
2007-06-24T15:57:12+00:00,140322504,140322359,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford","I have removed this because, due to other editing, it no longer makes sense."
2007-06-24T15:56:11+00:00,140322359,140322201,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford",I have removed this link because the link is of poor scholarship
2007-06-24T15:55:12+00:00,140322201,140321963,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford",I have changed this in order to better represent the comments by the Hall council
2007-06-24T15:53:40+00:00,140321963,140321810,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford",I have deleted this text because it is based on media hear-say rather than sound scholarship.
2007-06-24T15:52:31+00:00,140321810,140314890,1,Mpf1983,"Wycliffe Hall, Oxford","I have deleted this text because it was very misleading about the process which appointed Simon Vibert, it got his job title wrong, and quoted him out of context."
2007-06-24T15:49:29+00:00,140321340,140321022,1,Mpf1983,Richard Turnbull (theologian),"I have deleted these links to sources, because those sources are unscholarly information which could in fact be seen as liable."

2007-06-24T15:46:33+00:00,140320828,140320575,1,Mpf1983,Richard Turnbull (theologian),These comments about tithing and hell are gross misrepresentations of Richard's speech to Reform. So I have removed them.

2007-06-24T15:42:30+00:00,140320165,140319773,1,Mpf1983,Richard Turnbull (theologian),I have removed this section because it is very inaccurate. Only one member of staff has left the college in recent months. The rest of the text depends on saying that 'most staff have resigned'
