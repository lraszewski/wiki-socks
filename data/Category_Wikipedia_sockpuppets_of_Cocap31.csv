2020-01-10T15:09:15+00:00,935110566,932447218,1,Cocap31,Eric Schmitt,"Religious Freedom   In 2019, Schmitt spoke up in defense of a Missouri high school coach who was being attacked by the Freedom From Religion Foundation.  The foundation accused the football coach of violating the U.S. Constitution by leading students in prayer before and after games. In a letter, Schmitt said he would support the coach, school, and school district in a lawsuit if necessary and noted no one was forcing students and players to participate in prayer in public spaces."
