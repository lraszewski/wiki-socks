I have been following the events that have occurred over the last few days on this page. I really liked the edit that User: Mandolinryan submitted and that was eventually revoked. Since I really liked that edit and layout I decided to create an account and use the article as a template. I removed all biased and partial information and researched the rest. I deleted all information that I couldn't find sources for and kept the info that I could cite. Also I kept all sources from before
