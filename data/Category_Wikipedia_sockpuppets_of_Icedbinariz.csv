Although Farsi is a common term among some Iranian communities, Persian is the official term in the Iranian language for administrative purposes and the international community. The curse itself supercedes those who use Farsi, and again, advocates for the language internationally ask English speakers to use Persian. It is a misconception that Farsi is more 'socially correct,' referring to a dialect rather than the mother tongue."
