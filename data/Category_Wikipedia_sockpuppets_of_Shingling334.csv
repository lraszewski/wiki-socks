I’m clearly Macedonian and if you read the title Phillip of Macedon there is also a country called Macedonia. I have seen your past edits and you also like to put other countries on cuisines and such to make it seem vary. I also have the right to edit Wikipedia because I know in my country we call him that this is just political and extreme what you are doing. Please let’s stopmthis and putnit to bed.

2018-06-27T18:26:40+00:00,847779241,847777995,1,AlexanderTheGreat3212,Philip II of Macedon,THe reason I added Macedonian language because Phillip and Alexander the Great is also a national figure of Macedonian and is widely known as that. Just because greek could have been the native language it doesn’t make sense to be one sided. This is ludicrous. If a political figure is known by those names then it should be added.
