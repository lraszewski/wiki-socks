They mixed up the positions of Nodha and Budha Singh (born Desu, first convert to Sikhism in his lineage). In actuality, Nodha was the son of Budha, not vice versa. One of these family trees is an excerpt from a British Raj-era source ('Punjab Chiefs' by Lepel Griffin) and the other tree seems to be based on it. See 'Encyclopedia of Sikhism' by Harbans Singh and the index section of 'Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh' for confirmation."

The Afghans prevented a British residence in Kabul during the second Anglo-Afghan

The Afghan’s objective in the third Anglo-Afghan War was achieved - complete independence from the British

The Afghan Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union so it is wise to be specific that the native Afghans won the Soviet-Afghan war"
