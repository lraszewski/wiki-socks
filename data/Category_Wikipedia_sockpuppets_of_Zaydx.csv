They started uploading regularly on Sidemen and MoreSidemen channel in 2018, prior to that MoreSidemen channel didn't even exist and Sidemen channel was merely used to broadcast their football match & rare uploads. Unsourced content shouldn't be added, especially by people who have very limited knowledge of the group."
