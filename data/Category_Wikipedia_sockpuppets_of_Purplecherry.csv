Linked to Wikipedia definition of centres of excellence. Citation for the names of centres of excellence added.
2021-11-25T04:50:03+00:00,1057054361,1056767919,1,Purplecherry,International Livestock Research Institute,Added 'social' to description of ILRI research and reordered sentence to avoid repetition of 'impact'. ILRI researchers include anthropologists and gender specialists. 'Gender' is also named as one of their research themes.
2021-11-23T12:21:03+00:00,1056767919,1056767112,1,Purplecherry,International Livestock Research Institute,Added that it's ILRI's headquarters which are based in Nairobi. There are several country offices. Also added the name of the current director general and when they started the role.
2021-11-23T12:13:37+00:00,1056767112,1056089527,1,Purplecherry,International Livestock Research Institute,"Added a missing period. Also added a citation of an academic paper, stating that ILRI is a non-profit organization."

2021-11-19T14:32:38+00:00,1056065222,1056063500,1,Purplecherry,International Livestock Research Institute,"I changed the description of ILRI, which was inaccurate. Also dispute the use of term 'helps poor people' as a neutral or accurate descriptor of ILRI. ILRI is a research institution which researches livestock diseases, livestock foods, environmental issues, etc. It is not a charity as the phrase 'helps poor people' implies. This phrase is also insulting to the people of countries where ILRI researches. I have also added a citation  for ILRI's 'About us' page."
