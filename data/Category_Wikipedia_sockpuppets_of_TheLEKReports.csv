Rastafarians may love Amharic but it isn't historically important to put it in a language page. If you reverse this edit its factually by historical evidence inaccurate and will violate the moral grounds to it.

Rastafarian movement was created not Jamaica no Ethiopia. Because of these reasons I edited it out.
