Go through the history of the article. Many, and I mean MANY, individuals have agreed: including things related to non-English servers on the English Wikipedia page is nonsense, and including things like character classes and gears etc is trivia that shouldn't be included. The article you keep enforcing is literally filled with broken English, YOU ARE THE VANDAL."
