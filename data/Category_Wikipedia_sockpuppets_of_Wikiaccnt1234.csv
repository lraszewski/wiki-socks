2015-01-06T05:09:12+00:00,641192989,641191974,1,Sanjeev.08,Raheja Developers,Wikipedia is being used for advertising. Either in positive or negative way.

2015-01-06T04:47:24+00:00,641191147,641186752,1,Sanjeev.08,Raheja Developers,Cobrapost is not a credible website. They even do not mention about themselves in their website. Kathputli colony has its two sides - DDA and residents.
2015-01-05T05:27:16+00:00,641045017,640853892,1,Sanjeev.08,Raheja Developers,Kathputli colony is DDA's project. Builder is only working as their construction vendor. Qubrex and Cobrapost are not credible that can be used for references. I found that the writer from ForbesIndia is writing intentionally against the developer.
