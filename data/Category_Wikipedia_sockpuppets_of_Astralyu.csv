I've never found the slight hint to it, no one who worked on the game including Takumi has ever even mentioned 9/11 let alone anything to do with this, and it's been up with ""citation needed"" for ages. The only true part of it is that AA5 does feature the mentioned bombing case, but Takumi wasn't even involved in that game's development. It says it on the Dual Destinies page, ""Series creator Shu Takumi had no involvement in the title""; It doesn't make any sense."
