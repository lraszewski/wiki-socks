He is not a random independent researcher who came up with a theory. He is the first and most ardent promoter of Macedonian linguistics & historiography in the West, the first westerner to write a Macedonian grammar (with Yugoslav funding) AND a most ardent supporter of Samuel's ""Macedonian empire"". How impartial would he be to an artifact challenging all that? And are we under a duty to tell readers the backstory? From 1 to 10?"

If you want, put [[User:Garygo golob|Garygo golob]]'s map, as you said I put in myself a lot of effort to build a consensus around it, and it is obviously consensual, no one has complained about it, which is a minor miracle for the Balkans. So can we reach an agreement or will we continue to haggle?"
