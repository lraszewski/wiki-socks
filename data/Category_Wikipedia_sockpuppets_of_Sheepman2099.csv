There's absoutely no evidence that he actually attended the University of Colorado at age 8. He is also not an alumini of Grant High School (Los Angeles) and Hanyang University. He didn't complete the 12 years of mandatory education in 2 years. In fact, he barely passed the college entrance exam at 19. A good case of Ripley Syndrome."
2023-06-17T07:08:32+00:00,1160551476,1160529628,1,Sheepman2099,Kim Ung-yong,"He never attended the NASA. There is simply no proof other than his own statement. NASA does not accept a foreign national 8-year-old kid. There's no such record. Aslo, the dederal child labor law generally prohibits the employment of minors. If anyone seriously believe that he worked at NASA at age 8, I must say you are dumb. His father also confessed that it was a lie to attract public attention. What's worse, Kim failed at mathematics and English when he took a college entrance exam in Korea."
