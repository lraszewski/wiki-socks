2023-02-14T18:35:32+00:00,1139357652,1139356550,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Editing of the gallery. Old ortodox church in Sarajevo better represent the ortodox citizens as it is the oldest ortodox church in Sarajevo.
2023-02-14T18:28:14+00:00,1139356550,1139355501,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Editing of the obvious lie. Noone in Sarajevo calls their city Jerusalem of Europe. We are none of the religious center.
2023-02-14T18:21:20+00:00,1139355501,1139352914,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,This is ridiculous. Native name of Sarajevo can not be written in Vuk's serbian Cyrillic alphabet. They are third lagest erhnic group in Satajevo and by no way their script can be classified as native.
2023-02-14T18:08:50+00:00,1139353324,1139182622,1,Antiserb,Republika Srpska,Date is ruled as unconstitutinal.
2023-02-14T18:06:28+00:00,1139352914,1139352136,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Maps are made by a serbian nationist. There is no need for that on the Sarajevo's profile page.
2023-02-14T18:02:38+00:00,1139352136,1139342907,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Edition of the photos according the size of the religious groups in Sarajevo.

2023-02-14T10:05:59+00:00,1139288322,1139232445,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,These were not the maps of Sarajevo. These were the map of administrative region called Canton. No need to be presented on the page of the city. Also they are biased. They are made by a serb nationalist in order to show so called serbian presence in the surrounding of the city before Serbian aggression on Bosnia. Borders of the settlements were created in Serbia during Yugoslav times therefore they do not reflect real situation in 1991 nor in 2013.
2023-02-14T01:19:54+00:00,1139227210,1116515295,1,Antiserb,Mušan Topalović,Deletion of all false and deceiving statements.
2023-02-14T01:13:13+00:00,1139226334,1139183246,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Image is too much striking in comparison with other images.
2023-02-13T12:43:22+00:00,1139115192,1139020446,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,This mapping is not presented on the profile pages of other cities therefore it is totally missleading and irrelevant.
2023-02-11T20:28:36+00:00,1138820172,1138733070,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Photo is not appropriete hence its edited nature gives the most striking image out of the all presented.
2023-02-11T08:15:36+00:00,1138733070,1137902411,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Inaccurate and misleading representation of the demographics of the city.
2023-02-06T22:23:26+00:00,1137879628,1136677554,1,Antiserb,Sarajevo,Change reflects actuall situation and widely accepted nicknames of the city
2023-02-16T16:57:54+00:00,1139733717,1139732265,1,Lcdc22,Sarajevo,Photo of the ortodox church musnt be most impossing out of the all. Sarajevo is Bosniak city since its establishment date. Image also was too much striking. New photo is much more appropriate due to the older age of the structure.
2023-02-16T16:49:03+00:00,1139732265,1139731768,1,Lcdc22,Sarajevo,These are maps for Canton Sarajevo. There is city's profile page.
2023-02-16T16:45:48+00:00,1139731768,1139697570,1,Lcdc22,Sarajevo,Sarajevo is official name of the city. Also it is native name in official Bosnian language script: Latin.
2023-02-16T10:18:54+00:00,1139682625,1139682280,1,Lcdc22,Sarajevo,Better representation of the traditional churches in the city. Also correction of the false maps.
2023-02-16T10:15:31+00:00,1139682280,1139360356,1,Lcdc22,Sarajevo,Correction of the false statement.
