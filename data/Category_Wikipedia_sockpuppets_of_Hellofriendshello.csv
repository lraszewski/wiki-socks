It is unacceptable to keep the people in the dark about such situations, especially the parents deciding to place their children into the program. I am not an angry student, I am just an journalistic intern that wishes to enlighten the people about the lack of transparency from the program."

Therefore, I have doccumented fairly with sources under the controversy chapter. I have used the IB twitter thread to show just how much there is to speak about this. THe students have expressed all these concerns all over the internet, and although there is no article on this yet... it is evidently an issue. PLEASE NOTE: This is not just any exam complaint that you get, this is a serious matter."
