Williams' has not just acted in films, but on stage & other mediums, so Filmography (def: a list of films by an director or actor) is not the best heading. Just because other articles use it, does not matter. Acting Credits is wider & is better for being plain simple English. In fact the change to Acting Credits was requested during this articles Good article approval ."

Also added ""I and You""  to corresponding sub heading, as it is Williams 1st stage production. Years to come these headings might merge but atm they are a simple & handy division of her acting career."
