The story that you removed was about Bulan, a Bicolano god. You may be referring to what website Aswang Project found as a hoax, the VISAYAN Sidapa-Bulan myth. Bulan from BICOLANO myth is completely different from that. Additionally, AswangProject itself rebutted a Facebook user who was claiming that the Bicolano Bulan was hoax."
