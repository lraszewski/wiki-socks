You and Epinoia (probably the same person) tagged me as advertising and spamming.  That is ridiculous.

2020-03-07T18:39:28+00:00,944415347,944397477,1,Tusiplatinum,Deism,Dr. Shahin Soltanian is a PhD graduate in Philosophy from the University of Auckland (https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/32696). Kashfence Trust is a registered charity in New Zealand (https://www.register.charities.govt.nz/Charity/CC57113).  Epinoia should be doing his research before making omissions.

2020-03-08T05:50:42+00:00,944497850,944495499,1,BabakPoor,Deism,"The addition is not about a group but a philosophical idea! Rjensen. You seem to give different reasons for deleting each time. World Union of Deists is not a reliable source, hardly has any members and had one book published that is not popular. Desim page is missing any proper reference to any new age deism except WUD. So it seems you have an agenda."
2020-03-08T05:09:56+00:00,944493808,944420807,1,BabakPoor,Deism,"The previous editors making deletions added by tusiplatinum seem to have an agenda.  Stop being racist.  There is a new deistic movement, it has been referenced and sourced.  There is no need to have secondary sources talking about how popular it is.  That is not how it works in philosophical ideas.  Wikipedia is supposed to be the source for combined knowledge of humanity.  Some of those editors have made wikipedia pages for themselves."
