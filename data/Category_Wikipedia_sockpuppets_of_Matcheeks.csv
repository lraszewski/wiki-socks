2019-04-01T14:00:18+00:00,890460780,890457055,1,Matcheeks,Salomon Morel,So many people make an effort to change history. There was a clear division in Poland by nationality of people living there. SM was a Jew. Or a Polish Jew at least. Nobody is proud of him but that's up to Jews to face.

2019-04-01T13:12:38+00:00,890455135,890454817,1,Matcheeks,Salomon Morel,Salmon Morel was Jewish by nationality
2019-04-01T13:09:58+00:00,890454817,890454452,1,Matcheeks,Salomon Morel,SM was Jewish by nationality. He had Polish citizenship. And then he gained Israeli one. So his nationality was Jewish.
2019-04-01T13:04:28+00:00,890454207,890310426,1,Matcheeks,Salomon Morel,"No, Salmon Morel is not of Jewish background. He was Jewish. He happened to have Polish citizenship. If he was Polish of Jewish background then so were all the Holocaust victims."

2019-03-30T13:23:45+00:00,890150341,890042385,1,Matcheeks,Salomon Morel,"This fact that he was a Jew is highly important because for many decades Morel's action, genocide on Germans, were perceived as a permissible revenge on Germans for Holocaust. Genocide for genocide that is."

2019-03-05T14:54:56+00:00,886316135,886310394,1,Matcheeks,Ewa Kurek,"It is historically incorrect to deny Jewish colaboration with Germans in Holocaust through the Judenrats. The sources added are for that reason. No historian can dispute the claims that Kurek is making.  Also Kurek has three decades of solid research of Holocaust sources in Yiddish. Her views are commonly accepted views amongst historians that know these sources, especially as they are Jewish ones and come right from the Ghetto."
2019-03-05T14:11:45+00:00,886311452,886307079,1,Matcheeks,Judeopolonia,Reverting as in the previous form the article is historically and factually incorrect - it is based on biased sources hence adding more sources to give a broader view on what Judeopolinia is. It's not a myth.
