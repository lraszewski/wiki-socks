It would gross even more than Mother India which was to become the highest grossing Indian film of all time in 1957. This never happened and is practically impossible for a regional art film with no wide screening except Calcutta to gross that much in total either in India or overseas. And so  I've provided detail of its gross till 1980 which is much less than the previous source data
