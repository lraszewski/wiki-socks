2022-05-14T20:14:48+00:00,1087836008,1087477437,1,Dr_Patrick_McCoy,Fenian Rising,"We cannot know for certain the number of people who died in the 1867 rebellion. As well as this saying that only ""twelve people were killed across the country"" is boring. While leaving it ambiguous means that it could be any amount of people. That makes for a much more entertaining story. I also believe that leaving it ambiguous meaning that it could be a large amount of people killed allows Irish people to be proud of the 1867 rebellion and I believe that we should be allowed to be proud of it."
2022-04-13T15:51:11+00:00,1082512543,1077647717,1,Dr_Patrick_McCoy,Fenian Rising,I updated the number of people killed in the Fenian Rising of 1867 to be more accurate and to match the source that it cites.
