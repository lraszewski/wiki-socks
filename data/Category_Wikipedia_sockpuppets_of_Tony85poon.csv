Gautama Buddha's birthplace Lumbini may be located in what is today modern day southern Nepal close to Indian border. However, Buddhism started after Buddha attained enlightenment In Bodhgaya(India) and he delivered majority of his teachings in Sarnath, Rajgir and Sravasti, all of which are located in modern day India. He attained his Parinirvana and passed away in Kushinagar, India. Buddhism first spread out outside India during Ashoka's time. Both the famous Chinese monks Fa Xian and  Xuan tzang spent a large amount of time at Nalanda University(India). When it comes to highlighting the place of origins of Buddhism, its crucially important to highlight the entirety of Ganges plains of Northern India, as these are the places where the Buddha and his followers spent majority of their lives . I have added a better map from the wikipedia "" Silk Road transmission of Buddhism""."
