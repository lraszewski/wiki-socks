It's a ""fake/made up/false/immitation"" documentary which is known as a ""mockumentary"". Plus added some documentaries most of which fall under the umbrella title 'Stacey Dooley Investigates' at the beginning and then the 'main title' and then the 'episode title' all separated by colons. However the ones I have added are not part of the 'Investigates' series as shown in the BBC link."
