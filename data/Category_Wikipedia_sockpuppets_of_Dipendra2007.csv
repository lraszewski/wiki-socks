There are two competing theories. I want both the theories to have equal focus without one seeming more/less respectable than other. Kmzayeem undid that effort. The fact that it is regarding pohela-baishakh and not regarding bengali-calendar is inconsequential. We are discussing the same facts in both the topics. Nitish Sengupta's reference has also been cited.
