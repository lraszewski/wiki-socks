In the Middle Ages Jewishness was a theological description. Christian animus against Jews in this period was because of their rejection of Christ and not because of their ethnicity. Jesus and the Apostles were Jews. The Apostles make clear in the Gospels that they are no longer of the Jewish faith but followers of Christ by often referring to 'the Jews'.
