Jesus satisfied the wrath of God and the only reason humans are in danger is because they have not accepted the gift of Christ. We cannot rectify our sins for it is in our very nature to sin against God this is why we are in the precariously dangerous situation we are in. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved. Edwards made it clear that it is God's desire that the wicked should perish but it is by His mercy that we are not consumed. I felt as though using Edwards' terminalogy worked better to convey this.
