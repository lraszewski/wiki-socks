Kentucky Colonel is not a minor recognition. It is the highest title of honor bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Yes, hundreds of people have received it but do not ignore a fact that this title of honour is being given since 1813 (for last 207 years). We can not ignore/ underestimate the highest title of honour given by the Governor of State."
